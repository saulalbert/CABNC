Ginny (PS0CG)              [398] Poor little Herbie he'd erm, he'd got a double
Keith (PS0CH)              [399] Hernia.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [400] Hernia.
                           [401] Mm.
                           [402] They've taken away all the ... gubbins This is
                           Mrs who looked after Debbie's cats.
                           [403] Do you remember?
Keith (PS0CH)              [404] Taken away the grobbins?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [405] Grobbins?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [406] [laughing] [...] [] .
Keith (PS0CH)              [407] I don't know what ... I don't know what it is.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [408] Not even, not even I [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [409] [...] not grobbins no.
                           [410] They've castrated him at the same time
Keith (PS0CH)              [411] Oh.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [412] otherwise they couldn't get at things
                           properly.
                           [413] He's better off without them anyway.
                           [414] He's not a stud dog is he?
                           [415] But he looked so little.
                           [416] ... Looked so raw round his rear end.
                           [417] But she, she's restructured his insides.
                           [418] The muscle had wasted with the pressure of the
                           double hernia.
                           [419] The muscle had sort of disintegrated almost.
                           [420] She's had to use what muscle she can to
                           restructure his bowel.
                           [421] She's a marvellous surgeon.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [422] It's [...] of money [...] isn't it?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [423] Well the bill's nearly three hundred pound.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [424] Oh oh!
Keith (PS0CH)              [425] Jesus!
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [426] Now that wouldn't be feasible in your case
                           because [...] .
                           [427] So what we'd have to do is trade him in [...]

                           [430] It's in my lower back.
                           [431] I think it's where it's been, been higher up I
                           think it's more [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [432] Being what?
Keith (PS0CH)              [433] Well I've been holding it to save it.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [434] Yes.
                           [435] That's why you should have aspirin to relax
                           it.
                           [436] Cos it helps it mend.
Keith (PS0CH)              [437] Ooh.
                           [438] ... I feel as if I want to ... it hurts and I
                           feel as if I want to move it.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [439] Yes.
Keith (PS0CH)              [440] He's told me be very bloody careful cos it can
                           go out just like that.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [441] But he did tell you to move?
Keith (PS0CH)              [442] Oh yes but very very gently.
                           [443] He said tell it you're going to move.
                           [444] Don't do anything sudden.
                           [445] Tell it you're gonna move.
                           [446] I like the way he puts it.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [447] So the wrestling's out tonight is it?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [448] Oh [...]

Keith (PS0CH)              [458] Ooh Rocket ooh
Ginny (PS0CG)              [459] Yeah we got there for ten o'clock and we had
                           to wait till they'd finished all the out-patients
                           before they'd let the in-patients.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [460] In Mrs 's surgery.
                           [461] There were two doggies in their pens still ...
                           sparkers you know where they've had things
Keith (PS0CH)              [462] What'd do they do?
                           [463] Do they keep the doggie under sedation whilst
                           he's healing up?
                           [464] How long has he been there?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [465] Oh yes.
                           [466] ... No, no Herbie's not under sedation.
Keith (PS0CH)              [467] How long was he in there?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [468] Just over a night.
                           [469] [...] operation.
Keith (PS0CH)              [470] Oh he's had all that done?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [471] Yeah.
                           [472] Did the operation
Keith (PS0CH)              [473] How does he feel in himself?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [474] Well he was ... he heard Audrey's voice in the
                           waiting room
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [475] [laughing] Pretty bloody awful [] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [476] and he was whining [whine] .
                           [477] She said it's alright Herbie I'm here and he
                           [...] for a minute.
                           [478] And I said he's gonna do damage if he's trying
                           to get up at the door
Keith (PS0CH)              [479] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [480] the way a little Dachsie would you see?
Keith (PS0CH)              [481] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [482] So we talked to him but erm we didn't actually
                           see Mrs until about a quarter to eleven.
                           [483] And she said you know, on no account must he
                           strain.
                           [484] Obviously he's got dissolving stitches in.
                           [485] On his insides.
                           [486] And she said there was so little muscle ...
                           left.
                           [487] It had been so stretched and strained by [...]
                           .
                           [488] But she had to do the best she could [...] .
                           [489] Peter will [...] .
                           [490] ... And of course Audrey's not too quick on
                           her feet you see since she broke her hip.
                           [491] So I was trying to ... help Audrey and that
                           and help Herbie.
                           [492] So Herbie didn't try and jump in the car
                           before I could lift him and trying to get Audrey in
                           with her stiff leg.
                           [493] ... And then get the rug across her [...] .
                           [494] ... She didn't turn a hair when [...] ... she
                           said two hundred and ninety three pounds. ...
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [495] I suppose it's like anything.
                           [496] You get an estimate for it.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [497] Well it's cheaper than [...] I suppose.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [498] Parts and labour [...] .
                           [499] Parts and labour.
Keith (PS0CH)              [500] Eh?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [501] Does it come with a three month guarantee?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [502] Cheaper than princess ... princess Margaret or
                           [...] .
                           [503] No Mrs said she was very lucky.
                           [504] She'd been to three lectures [...] .
                           [505] One of the topmost veterinary surgeons in
                           Europe.
Keith (PS0CH)              [506] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [507] And that's why Mrs asked her to do it.
                           [508] She'd actually seen it done.
                           [509] Seen slides and been to lectures on it.
                           [510] I don't know it must be wonderful to be able
                           to mend [...] .
                           [511] To rebuild his rear end. ... [banging]
Keith (PS0CH)              [512] Hope he comes out of it.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [513] Well as long as nothing breaks, nothing gets
                           [...] .
                           [514] No, now way must he strain so she's, she's got
                           some liquid paraffin to drop on his dinner. [...]
Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [515] Quite a major operation.
                           [516] He's been ever so bright.
                           [517] Walking about quite well, he did turn to lick
                           his ... under his tail but his little tail was
                           wagging.
                           [518] And he was walking fine.
                           [519] He even stopped and had a tinkle.
Keith (PS0CH)              [520] See they don't know it's to hurt.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [521] No ... no.
                           [522] No I think I think animals are fantastic they
                           way they put up with pain.
                           [523] Because they can't tell you.
                           [524] ... And after a major operation there he was
                           wagging his tail and
Keith (PS0CH)              [525] You don't know the threshold of pain in
                           animals do you?
                           [526] ... Can't tell you.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [527] Well no.
Keith (PS0CH)              [528] Very seldom you hear a dog or a [...] in pain.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [529] Oh you do. ... [...]
Keith (PS0CH)              [530] Oh [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [531] What's the matter? ...
Keith (PS0CH)              [532] Odd.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [533] What's odd? ...
Keith (PS0CH)              [534] [...] ... I think it's getting better.
                           [535] The muscle's gone
Ginny (PS0CG)              [536] [...] ... Do you want a cup of coffee?
                           [537] ... Cup of herbal tea?
                           [538] ... An aspirin?
                           [539] ... Nothing I can do you for?
                           [540] ... Oh you're [...] book's upstairs.
                           [541] Do you want that?
                           [542] [...] . ... Is it actual pain then, or
                           stiffness?
                           [543] ... Or just that you're frightened to move?
                           [544] ... Ache?
Keith (PS0CH)              [545] Oh a bad, bad ache.
                           [546] General bad bad ache.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [547] Well you could have just one aspirin.
Keith (PS0CH)              [548] I've had one upstairs.
                           [549] I took one [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [550] No that was ages ago dear.
                           [551] It was half past seven this morning.
Keith (PS0CH)              [552] It wasn't!
                           [553] When I came up.
                           [554] It was late.
                           [555] ... You were up getting dressed.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [556] No.
                           [557] I brought you a hot water bottle [...] your
                           aspirin.
                           [558] When I let the dog out.
Keith (PS0CH)              [559] Yeah but I didn't take it then.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [560] You didn't take it then no [...] .
                           [561] You could have another one love.
                           [562] It would relax your muscles. ... [...] ?
Keith (PS0CH)              [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [563] No it's probably gone.

                           [795] ... Oh no that's, that's where I usually get
                           them.
                           [796] In that ... bin.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [797] These are thirty p.
                           [798] They're quite [...] .
                           [799] And then robins on the front.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [800] Oh they're nice aren't they?
                           [801] How many to a pack, six?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [802] I don't know.
                           [803] Er
Ginny (PS0CG)              [804] Looks quite a lot.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [805] Ten.
                           [806] That's not bad.
                           [807] For thirty p.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [808] Jesus incredible.
                           [809] Isn't it?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [810] That's good isn't it?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [811] I suppose they're all alike but they've put
                           different ones on the outside.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [812] Well they must be similar.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [813] Erm ... casseroles.
                           [814] They probably won't have any cos it's winter
                           now.
                           [815] They only sell casseroles and things in the
                           summer.
                           [816] Oh look.
                           [817] ... There's one but it's not a, not a three
                           pint.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [818] Three or four pints she said.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [819] Mm.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [820] Is that Pyrex?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [821] Well it's, it's the French equivalent.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [822] Is it?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [823] Mm.
                           [824] Arcal crystau d'arc yes.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [825] I don't know.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [826] Or crystau d'arc whatever you like to call it.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [827] No, she said ... well she means an oven dish.
                           [828] Still they're very nice.
                           [829] I wish they'd got a bigger one.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [830] What size are they then?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [831] Two ... one and a half to two pint I would
                           think.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [832] Oh they're not very big are they?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [833] And ... that's a water set.
                           [834] ... Hello love!
Vicky (PS0CK)              [835] Hello.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [836] You haven't got any larger casserole dishes
                           have you?
Vicky (PS0CK)              [837] No [...] .
                           [838] You want the great big one [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [839] Mm
Vicky (PS0CK)              [840] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [841] about a three pinter.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [842] Yeah.
                           [843] [...] ten pound one.
                           [844] No we do one like this, in this [...] colour,
                           Pyrex but a big one .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [845] Oh that's alright.
                           [846] But you haven't got one?
Vicky (PS0CK)              [847] But no, it's that one there.
                           [848] That's the size up from that one.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [849] Yeah.
                           [850] That's what we want, yes.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [851] Yeah.
                           [852] ... But ... haven't got one.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [853] Oh you rotten thing.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [854] Actually ask the girls and if they get them,
                           go up the warehouse next week ... they'll bring you
                           one. ...
Ginny (PS0CG)              [855] They're nice, those.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [856] They're ever so popular.
                           [857] We sell a lot of them.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [858] One point five Q T it's got on there.
                           [859] Quarts is it?
                           [860] One point five?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [861] Quarts?
                           [862] One point five quarts.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [863] What's that in English? [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [864] Well one quart is two pints.
                           [865] And a half a quart is one pint.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [866] Right.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [867] That'd make it the three pints.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [868] So you'd want the next one up wouldn't you?
                           [869] That would be that one.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [870] Well it's a three or four pints she's after.
                           [871] It's probably a four [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [872] It doesn't look big enough.
                           [873] Are you sure it says one point five quarts?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [874] Well it says it on there somewhere.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [875] [...] one point five quart.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [876] Well.
                           [877] Perhaps it's ... perhaps they hold more than
                           you think they do.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [878] I don't know. [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [879] What do you think Dinda?
                           [880] Should I take this one?
                           [881] While
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [882] Erm
Ginny (PS0CG)              [883] they've still got it.
                           [884] It's the last one.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [885] It's not chipped or anything is it?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [886] No. ...
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [887] [...] I've got my hands full and you've got
                           your hands full. ...
Ginny (PS0CG)              [888] Three pint.
                           [889] See we might not get one more in before
                           Christmas.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [890] I'll ask Gill and Maureen
Ginny (PS0CG)              [891] Mm.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [892] [...] take that but then if you, if you really
                           don't think that will hold what you want then you'll
                           have to bring it back.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [893] It's a, it's a, it's a Christmas present [...]
                           .
Vicky (PS0CK)              [894] Oh I see yeah.
                           [895] Ah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [896] Three to four pints she said.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [897] That looks ... yeah looking at it
Vicky (PS0CK)              [898] I think it [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [899] It's quite capacious, actually.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [900] Yeah.
                           [901] ... I think
Ginny (PS0CG)              [902] It's a nice dish.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [903] Have you ... we haven't got a measuring jug.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [904] Haven't got any what?
Vicky (PS0CK)              [905] That is right isn't it?
                           [906] One pint is
Ginny (PS0CG)              [907] Well a quart is two pints.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [908] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [909] And point five of a quart is one pint.
                           [910] That makes it three pints.
                           [911] Why they can't put three pints on instead of
                           one point five quarts .
Vicky (PS0CK)              [912] But does she want a three to four one?
                           [913] If she wants a three to four you gotta have
                           the next size up.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [914] Three stroke four
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [915] Well she said ... three or four.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [916] Oh I see.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [917] so obviously she was easy about the size.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [918] I think that would be ample cos usually
                           there's only two of them
Ginny (PS0CG)              [919] There's only two of them, yes
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [920] to eat anything you know [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [921] yes, yes.
                           [922] True.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [923] Yeah I think we should grab it while we see it
                           actually.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [924] I think we should too.
                           [925] It'll be half the price it is in Boot's
                           Cookshop .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [926] [laugh] Do you want me ... Do you want me to
                           drop it or should you drop it?
Vicky (PS0CK)              [927] I don't know.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [928] [laugh] Do you remember Jackie, he used to be
Vicky (PS0CK)              [929] [...] another one look.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [930] Yes.
                           [931] And that that one holds quite a lot
Vicky (PS0CK)              [...]
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [932] No.
                           [933] No.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [934] Do you remember Jackie?
                           [935] He used to be dark haired and worked in the
                           ... toy shop in Sandhurst.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [936] Yes I do.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [937] Yeah I thought you would.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [938] [...] I knew the face.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [939] Used to go in for your model paints and ...
                           coloured marbles
Vicky (PS0CK)              [940] That's right, yeah.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [941] There you go.
                           [942] Long time, long time ago.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [943] All those years I was there
Ginny (PS0CG)              [944] You haven't, haven't changed .
                           [945] You haven't changed.
                           [946] I mean your face I knew straight out.
                           [947] It was your hair that got me.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [948] Well the grey come through and I was just sort
                           of I thought I can't wait all those years ... with
                           dark hair.
                           [949] I had a friend who had long hair and she, she
                           let it grow right the way through.
                           [950] And for nearly seven years she looked like an
                           old woman of eighty.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [951] Yes.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [952] And I thought I am not gonna have that.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [953] Well that's right.
                           [954] I agree with you.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [955] So [...] I more or less had a crew cut.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [956] Yes.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [957] And er of course it's still grey now
Ginny (PS0CG)              [958] Yes.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [959] except like this bit here which er grows [...]

Ginny (PS0CG)              [960] I know, oh yes it always grows a dark bit.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [961] but that all took ... I think, when you're
                           older ... when you go grey it's, it, you look softer
                           and you get away with the grey coming through on
                           white hair.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [962] Yes.
                           [963] That's right.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [964] But on dark hair.
                           [965] I mean for years when I was young I was jet
                           black and that was lovely.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [966] Yes.
                           [967] That's right.
                           [968] You were.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [969] I never had to touch it or nothing.
                           [970] But when you start going grey you look so
Ginny (PS0CG)              [971] It's pepper and salt then.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [972] And your skin changes.
                           [973] I used to be right tanned skin.
                           [974] And that, that even changes as you get older.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [975] Yeah that's right.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [976] Yes well I, I was very fair to start with.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [977] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [978] And then it began to get a bit darker.
                           [979] Not my eyelashes and eyebrows they're silver.
                           [980] Always silver.
                           [981] ... Absolutely silver.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [982] [...] Mine are ... yeah, dark still.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [983] But my, I thought no I'm not gonna go pepper
                           and salt.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [984] That's right yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [985] I don't mind going silver.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [986] That's right.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [987] This is natural silver on the temples.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [988] That's right.

                           because er, you can only get the money, I mean

Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1368] Yeah.
Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [1369] I mean if they could open nine days a week,
                           they couldn't get any more money out of me because

                           or something and then go on a Sunday, now I think
                           it's nice to have a, a day when nothing happens.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1376] Yes, when it's all quite all the shops are
                           closed .

                           agree with you, it's just nice to have one day a
                           week where everything is peaceful.
Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [1383] That's right, yeah, where as it's now they're
                           all going to open up, gonna go chasing around

                           part time jobs for college leavers and things if
                           they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and
                           they did, give them a foot up to start a job, then
                           get taken on you know as ... [...] .

                           supermarket's but I'll shop at Lionel's on the way
                           back.

Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [1403] Mm, mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1404] And he'll often say to me look there's a
                           fresh box under there, help yourself to what you
                           want, i haven't opened that box.

                           time you go in if you say anything about it

Ginny (PS0CG)              [1654] Sycamore oh, sycamore and [...] .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1655] used to get told to go out in the Autumn and
                           we used to get told by the, used to get taken out by
                           the teacher into some woods and you would have to
                           collect the leaves [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1656] Actually I
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1657] Could always , could always see if [...]
                           biggest, biggest leaves like these you know, [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1658] That is a Sycamore cos it isn't a, there
                           isn't a conker tree around here that's Sycamore,
                           there they are, that's it, that's a Sycamore tree,
                           beautiful colour ... These are [...] Dances with
                           Wolves.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1659] Oh, it's [...] in shop.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1660] If it's
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1661] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1662] If it's good, erm, can I say truthful
                           background of the Indians .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1663] Well, [...] actually [...] and it might be
                           based on a true story, don't know if it
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1664] Do you remember when Vaughan was, Vaughan was
                           doing his meditation
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1665] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1666] and he was trying to get in touch with a
                           North American Indian, that a, thingamy in Wales was
                           fixed up
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1667] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1668] Wonder what ever came of that.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1669] Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about
                           things like that, because you asked a straight
                           forward and he goes way, way, over the head
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1670] Yeah, I know , he does versify.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1671] and within three seconds my brain just
                           switches off [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1672] Well I try to
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1673] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1674] I, I just ask him if, and it, the question
                           that I'm interested in the answer to, like how did
                           it go? and, now he talks at me for an hour until
                           Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany, [...] cos
                           she can see I sort of trying to edge away ...
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1675] [...] suddenly cross your legs, ouch [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1676] That's a good idea.
                           [1677] She said to me just say to him like I do
                           enough Vaughany, don't want to hear any more.
                           [1678] I said no, I, I would hate to offend him
                           because it's all so well meant ... being a mother in
                           law you have to watch it.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1679] [laugh] , honestly you couldn't be much worse
                           than [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1680] Oh [...] mother in law is.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1681] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1682] She's just .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1683] I'm not buying her a present, I mean I'll
                           chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if
                           it comes, but we'll have to go to [...] , but erm,
                           you know, she, [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1684] As a person, you know, I'd never have any
                           time .
                           [1685] Yes, yes, I mean you never, she lives in that
                           great place and she's got no money
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1686] [...] , they're not, they're not her presents
                           are they, they're from Diane.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1687] No, of course, of course .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1688] So, I tell you what, if, if we do end up
                           spending Christmas at [...] gonna give me the
                           present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving
                           Stella the [...] Christmas present [laugh] .
                           [1689] It so [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1690] I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate
                           her but I .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1691] I couldn't I'm afraid.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1692] Well, could do, what I can't forgive is that
                           she was so spiteful to my daughter, she's a sun
                           shiny little sole and she's so full of love for
                           everybody she's so generous
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1693] Why was she?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1694] she didn't want Vaughany to get married
                           again.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1695] Oh.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1696] She used to say what Diane, I've never heard
                           of a Diane, after they were married this
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1697] [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1698] And when anyone treats my daughter like that
                           I find it very hard to forgive, I know it hurts my
                           kids, I'm much more up in arms than if they hurt me.
                           [1699] Remember that first Christmas when she put
                           the cat among the pigeons by saying to me your
                           husband told me that he can't really afford he's
                           flying because you spend all his money, when I, when
                           I've been backing him, saving money for his
                           aeroplane and his lessons and
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1700] What did you say to dad? ... did you say that
                           to dad didn't you say it [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1701] But I thought she was stirring it you see and
                           so did Diane.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1702] What did you tell [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1703] I didn't believe her
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1704] You didn't, you never .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1705] But he said, I said it as a joke when she was
                           asking me about my flying and I said I don't do as
                           much flying as I'd like to, I've, I've got a wife to
                           support and she takes all the money.
                           [1706] But I said I am the money ... I gave him his
                           first flying lesson, I paid for it, like I bought
                           his first three cars.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1707] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1708] I excused myself and went to bed I think ...
                           but she repeated it so solemnly you see not as, say
                           somebody saying a joking sort of way.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1709] Yeah, good stirring [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1710] And it was just after Frank had left her and
                           gone to live in that place in [...] .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1711] Does, does anybody know what he's doing,
                           [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1712] Don't know, last time I asked Diane she said
                           oh he's, he's living with this machine he's got in
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1713] What machine?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1714] some magic machine.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1715] What machine?
                           [1716] Magic machine?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1717] Yes.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1718] What kind of machine?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1719] A machine he's designed, I don't know for
                           what purpose, I didn't dare ask, I was going to ask
                           Vaughan .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1720] It's not to, it's not to isolate gamma rays
                           [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1721] Probably, but he was hiding he wouldn't come
                           out because he said that the men from outer space
                           were after him.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1722] It's funny you know, I've reading, I'm
                           reading Silence of, Silence of the Lambs at the
                           moment and er, you know, it's got in there, a lot of
                           er, er, mentally ill patient's have got this idea
                           that, men, men from Mars have [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1723] Well I said to Diane you know, I didn't
                           laugh, I didn't think it was funny, I thought it was
                           sad and I said but he needs help, if Vaughan's you
                           know, he's got two sons, but Mark's a bit hopeless
                           and he was at Oxford anyway, I said surely somebody
                           should go and get him some ... some treatment,
                           sanitation.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1724] Yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1725] You can get cranks, you just believe in
                           flying saucers and a quite happy harmless, but, I
                           think they need checking on to make sure that they
                           are ... happy with the life they're leading ... it
                           bothers me a lot
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1726] So where is he now?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1727] Well he's still in Manchester I think.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1728] Doing what?
                           [1729] Is he living with, living in a [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1730] I think he's in lodgings.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1731] Is he?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1732] But of course he got half the value of ...
                           Trafford Hall, which was quarter of a million?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1733] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1734] Something like that, eighth of a million,
                           it'll do me anyway.
                           [1735] Oh listen to that bird, isn't it beautiful
                           it's a Thrush.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1736] Well [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1737] That's alright [...] degradable.
                           [1738] Oh isn't it beautiful, he must think it's
                           Spring.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1739] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1740] Oh it's gorgeous ... oh you beautiful bird.
                           [bird singing] .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1741] Oh, [...] in't he?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [1742] Like a spring sound.
                           [1743] I hope they don't start nesting and then get
                           all there [...] .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [1744] [...] have a good time [...] wouldn't you?
                           [1745] Yes

Ginny (PS0CG)              [1752] Really doing his nut isn't he?
                           [1753] Perhaps that is his er, this is, this is my
                           place, [...] .
                           [1754] Yes, there he goes ... yes it was a Thrush
                           ... You must come and try and hear the nightingale's

Ginny (PS0CG)              [1935] I'm all ready if I got my handbag, but when I

                           morning.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2028] Why, you wouldn't come very early in the
                           morning.

                           Queen Elizabeth the first spent all her girl hood.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2037] I've no idea.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2038] [...] ... perhaps it was burnt down and re-
                           built or something [...] didn't seem at all tudorish
                           did it?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2039] [...] .

Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2042] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2043] Way back in the thirteen, fourteenth century.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2044] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2045] And your name sake Barnard of Bolier that's
                           his palace opposite on the other bank of the Thames.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2046] Mm ... [...] .
                           [2047] I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2048] Eighty gardens, oh [...] made me laugh.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2049] Well that's not what amazes me, eighty
                           gardens.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2050] Eighty gardens, but then as a place that
                           size, and the didn't have any machinery don't forget
                           everything had to be
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2051] Well I expect now, they've got about five .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2052] I should think they probably still, in the,
                           in the high season, I should think they probably
                           still need fifteen, twenty
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2053] Oh look, [...] tractor [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2054] I think it still belongs to the Duke of
                           Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end
                           wasn't he?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2055] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2056] And he said they have to systematically sell
                           something to keep the place up.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2057] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2058] But if they can use that er beautiful water
                           ...
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2059] Ah right.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2060] to generate their own electricity, save them
                           a bomb and they can sell some as well.
                           [2061] I know a lot of people say they shouldn't
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2062] Good idea .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2063] have houses that size, but I think it's an
                           awful shame to let our heritage go.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2064] Yeah, I agree, if people did [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2065] I tell you another thing that amazes me, how
                           any one with a Sovereign right, [...] were a
                           Sovereign in those days, could have given up the
                           palace of Westminster which is so beautiful, [...]
                           palace, together I suppose reigned after the Duke of
                           [...] is it?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2066] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2067] It was only built erm, what a couple of
                           hundred years ago wasn't it?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2068] What Buckingham Palace?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2069] Mm.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2070] I don't know, I didn't realise.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2071] At Kensington, Kensington palace, but the
                           palace of Westminster I think is the most beautiful
                           building
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2072] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2073] and of course they had the Thames which was
                           their main highway, Thames was much easier to use
                           than
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2074] Well that was Buckingham Palace was er [...]
                           .

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2077] Oh yeah.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2078] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2079] I think Buckingham Palace is lovely compared
                           to Westminster Palace, beautiful old stone and the,
                           and the shape of it and it's windows, it's beautiful
                           ... huge of course, there again the court then had
                           loads and loads of er, there were ten [...] .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2080] [laugh] . [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2081] And a lot of the Government, Governing people
                           of the country ... Oh it is a bit chill and damp
                           isn't it?
                           [2082] Did you mention anything to your dad about
                           wanting to watch ... Dances with Wolves?
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2083] Ah, I wouldn't of imagine for one second he
                           would want to watch, so it might be better if I buy
                           the video and see [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2084] No, no ,

Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2087] heart's delight.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2088] something more adventure, I don't want to buy
                           it, I may, I may not be that keen on it
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2089] Well you know, in that case you'll have to
                           wait until he goes away somewhere for the evening.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2090] Didn't like Fantasia, where I can listen to
                           the music and watch them.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2091] Oh, we'll see what's going on, have a look
                           [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2092] I would like to see Dances with Wolves ...
                           he'll probably be asleep any way Dinda.
                           [2093] He puts the Variety Performance on he'll go
                           to sleep.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2094] Mm ...
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2095] He's actually been out of his armchair today
                           long enough to erm, spend ten minutes putting a
                           washer on the hand basin in the loo.

Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2292] Mm ... oh, I'm warm now after that walk.

Jackie (PS0CM)             [2331] Cos I think they'd gone some time ago.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2332] What a shame they've missed their walk
                           together.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2333] Yes, still, you just going back now are you?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2334] No, we came a bit earlier because it was so
                           dingy.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2335] Just done the circuit, he has.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2336] Oh I see, I did the front of my car that's
                           why I was a bit late, I usually I'm a bit earlier
                           than this.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2337] We met er, a beautiful old English sheep dog,
                           seven months old and they've got to find a new home
                           for it, because they're off to America.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2338] Ah, that's a shame .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2339] Well I said they're except British dogs in
                           America.
                           [2340] Dog's from England can go anywhere, it's just
                           coming back in, the problem .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2341] Come back in yes, the erm
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2342] And he said yes but it's, it's the
                           accommodation we've got, maybe it's a Company move
                           and they've given them an apartment or something,
                           seven months old, you know, that big, so by the time

Jackie (PS0CM)             [2343] It's a shame isn't it?,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2344] she's grown up, she's

                           wants one .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2348] Oh yeah, you know .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2349] Well I should think they'd probably advertise
                           .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2350] [...] at the vet's and so on, you know.

Jackie (PS0CM)             [2359] Oh yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2360] That's where, where it fell off in all the
                           hurricane.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2361] That's right, yeah.

                           open fire in the winter.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2397] No, I wouldn't
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2398] I miss it now after all these years.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2399] Oh never mind, when I was first married, it
                           was carry coals up two flight of stairs to start
                           with.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2400] Oh [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2401] It was me who did it, not my husband.
                           [2402] He use to sit there and say, is it getting
                           cold in here? and muggings I use to get up and feed
                           the fire and go down and [...] , I, I can't believe
                           it when I think back you know.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2403] Well you do exactly the same thing now ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2404] Yes ,
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2405] it's obviously in your nature isn't it?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2406] yes .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2407] Turn the heating up I should think.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2408] Yeah, yeah, you know if there's anything to
                           be done, up she goes and does it.

Jackie (PS0CM)             [2412] You know, [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2413] Well we used to take it in our stride, I mean
                           I grew up with an old Victorian house with potent
                           fires and you had keep the fires going either wise
                           in the winter it was bitterly cold, it was nice and
                           cool in the summer coming out of the heat.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2414] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2415] But in the winter you needed the kitchen
                           range and the dining room and drawing room needed
                           fire then, and if anybody's was ill we had
                           fireplaces in the bedrooms of course.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2416] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2417] But since I slept in, what used to be the
                           maid's bedroom [laugh] , I was always
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2418] I say, when you look at those days you wake

                           admit.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2421] Old, old sash windows .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2422] I wouldn't, I wouldn't last five minutes
                           [laugh] .
                           [2423] I need my heating .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2424] Oh, [...] you would , you would.

                           round them.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2427] But, it's, it's funny though you [...] didn't
                           they?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2428] Stone floors down stairs .
                           [2429] Would you know, we didn't have any serious
                           illnesses as children, the only place we had a bit
                           of warmth, used to have a valour lamp in the
                           bathroom in the winter, had a valour lamp in there
                           to keep the chill off .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2430] Remember those [...] ones we used to have,

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2434] handle with a bit of erm,
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2435] It used to have a handle come right over when
                           you lifted it up .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2436] That's right, yeah, that's it, yes , and

Jackie (PS0CM)             [2469] Erm he's about seven, but I'm not sure how
                           old when I first had him, cos he's a stray, a stray

                           be we reckon, no
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2477] Rocket must be about nine or ten , oh.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2478] well he should only be eight and a half, I
                           mean they told us he was three and a half when he
                           was rescued .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2479] well we'll call him nine , he must be about
                           nine.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2480] They told us three and a half, but there
                           again a lot of rescue people do cut the ages of
                           their dog, but, but, our, our two vets agreed he was
                           around three and a half, between three and a half
                           and four, look at his teeth and his coat and his
                           bones .
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2481] His eyes .

                           you?
                           [2489] Still a great puppy, yes, yes.
                           [2490] Rocket's fifty six, catching up on me.
                           [2491] Oh there's Sheba, she's aged, by Jove she's
                           aged ,

Jackie (PS0CM)             [2493] I mean Roxanna at her age wasn't still very
                           full of life ,
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2494] [...] .

Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2496] [...] aged quite rapidly, we were lucky with
                           ours [...] cos at the time I couldn't, you know
                           thought she was about twelve ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2497] She's very well looked after ,
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2498] till she was about twelve she was quite [...]

                           chasing sticks and
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2500] [...] .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2501] I think it depends on the size .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2502] Thirteen she was .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2503] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2504] Actually she's not simply long coated like
                           Roxanna was she's over coated if anything.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2505] Yeah, she is, very, very long .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2506] She is, she is , Very seldom you see a dog
                           like that.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2507] She's very heavy and the size of her feet.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2508] Mm, mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2509] In fact she's a throw back, it's as almost as
                           though she's got some ... some ... Alaskan type dog
                           in her

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2514] No, no ... no she's not quite full of big
                           boned, but by Joe

                           don't know what they're looking at [laughing] .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2516] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2517] They're probably listening , listening for
                           the foxes or something.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2518] Heard something over there.
Dinda (PS0CJ)              [2519] [...] , [whistle] .

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2522] Yeah.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2523] Saves leaving them in the car, probably only
                           for about two hours, I don't know if it's better
                           leaving at home or taking with me, there's [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2524] Don't you , don't you find he'd rat he'd much
                           happier sitting in the car?
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2525] He seems to be, yes
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2526] Than left at home, where you've gone away
                           somewhere without him .
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2527] Well I don't really know, cos I don't know
                           what he's like at home, you see by himself, huh.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2528] No, exactly .
                           [2529] But my dogs have always, much rather come

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2535] But, oh he's quite happy , he'll curl up in
                           the back of a car, but when I come home and he goes
                           so berserk if I've left him at home, I know that
                           he's been watching and listening and waiting for me
                           all that time.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2536] He usually sits up at the window [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2537] That's right, yeah ,

Jackie (PS0CM)             [2540] Yes that's true.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2541] I think they work it out that way.

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2549] Oh, that's where we usually end up I'm
                           afraid.

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2568] [...] , they, remember last, end of last
                           winter when it got mild after the cold spell, they
                           were building their nests and then we got all that
                           cold weather again, all the, all the fledglings were
                           dead.

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2570] Nests I found when I was clearing the garden,
                           put the little eggs in and they'd all gone cold.

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2575] They heard the geese know when to fly North,
                           and when to fly South and navigate by the stars and
                           by the lay lines in the earth, it's just isn't it
                           magical?
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2576] [...] .

                           that's why you find monuments built up on hills so
                           they could stand in the middle of the of nowhere and
                           they could see a, they could either feel it through
                           their feet
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2580] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2581] where the, where the main lines were, or they
                           could look and see erm, what do you call them, those
                           groups of trees on tops of hills they used
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2582] Oh I know.

                           they haven't got the sun or the stars, yeah, yeah,
                           we've lost all that of course, as we got what we
                           called civilised, we've lost all those old skills.
Jackie (PS0CM)             [2588] [...] .

                           [...] , and he came down for it and he took it, so

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2796] Well I phoned you twice before, and there's

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2820] Good girl Ludabelle.
None (PS0CR)               [2821] he charges off with such enthusiasm, usually
                           in the wrong direction [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2822] Oh poor old Rocket, he, he runs after the
                           ball, then runs past it and leaves it

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2824] he won't, won't really play.
None (PS0CR)               [2825] Well actually a girl friend of mine came

                           here and was thoroughly miserable all the way round,
                           without his ball his lost, you know, a dog walk
                           isn't a dog walk for Henry.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2826] A stick won't do?
None (PS0CR)               [2827] No, chases it twice and then Lucy takes on
                           and eats it for him.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2828] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [2829] So anyway, how's life been with you?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2830] Oh, not bad.
None (PS0CR)               [2831] Good.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2832] But tediously, but same as usual .

Ginny (PS0CG)              [2843] Couldn't be more right, except that
None (PS0CR)               [2844] It's a funny thing though, because mother's
                           and daughter's [...] , and er, I love, when my mum
                           comes up she's a dreadful sleeper and if you're
                           having a bad time, you get up in the middle of the
                           night to go and make a cup of tea, there's always a
                           little voice says, yes, let's have a cup of tea
                           dear.
                           [2845] And you can sit and rabbit
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2846] Yeah.
None (PS0CR)               [2847] to the point where my father-in-law woken up
                           in his room with hilarious giggles which don't take
                           long to ensue
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2848] [laugh] .
None (PS0CR)               [2849] and it's one of life's real treats.

                           a little too
None (PS0CR)               [2853] Protective of you.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2854] yes and she cannot discriminate her feelings.
None (PS0CR)               [2855] Mm, mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2856] When she disapproves of something you've said
                           or done.
None (PS0CR)               [2857] As it comes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2858] Well she does, she doesn't say it, she
None (PS0CR)               [2859] [...] ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2860] doesn't say all that much, she'll probably
                           just get up and walk out of the room or, or heave a
                           big sigh or something.
None (PS0CR)               [2861] yeah.

                           mean he's quite capable looking after himself for a
                           weekend, you know my father had a series of stroke's
                           when he was in his fifties
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2868] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [2869] mainly because of hard work, self induced, he
                           was just a compulsive workaholic
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2870] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [2871] and, he loved what he did, he [...] that
                           nobody could have survive, and then my mother who's
                           mentally unimpaired, but in sudden decay [...]
                           overnight and she has to look after him [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2872] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [2873] but having said that she's got a [...] sort
                           of ready meal, all you have to do is use one hand
                           either pick your plate up, put it in the microwave
                           and you've got a cooked meal
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2874] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [2875] and [...] on his own, and said to mum, come
                           up here and get away for the weekend, cos it's a
                           hell of a burden to carry, with no release, I mean
                           even going on holiday, she has to book it, organise
                           his packing, wash it, you name it, [...] .

                           be like this.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2880] The first time we had a break together, Dinda
                           said let's go out, I said well somewhere fairly
                           close where we can take little Rocket

None (PS0CR)               [2889] mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2890] Would you believe that he said I've got to

                           telephone number and a fully detailed map.
None (PS0CR)               [2893] Why is he so helpless?.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [2894] I said, that, erm, begrudgingly I must admit,
                           I said, you gonna stay overnight, no, no, I've come
                           to take you both out to dinner.

                           as we've gone through the front door, he'd gone to
                           the Little Chef for breakfast because there weren't
                           any crocks left to u , to use

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3074] Erm, he'll come in in the evening he's done
                           the shopping, he cleans the house, they live in a
                           converted barn
None (PS0CR)               [3075] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3076] so you can imagine how big it is.
None (PS0CR)               [3077] don't.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3078] He vacuums, he cooks her a meal
None (PS0CR)               [3079] Oh god
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3080] To try and tempt her appetite because she's
                           throwing up
None (PS0CR)               [3081] Did you say she had two son's?, is the other
                           one married?.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3082] Two sons , the other one's dead.
None (PS0CR)               [3083] Oh shame [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3084] Yep.
None (PS0CR)               [3085] That's my sort of chap.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3086] Yep.
                           [3087] I'm afraid he er
None (PS0CR)               [3088] Yet there are some around .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3089] he was one of the sixties products who got
                           onto all the drugs and things
None (PS0CR)               [3090] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3091] Yep, and had a stroke, a brain haemorrhage .
None (PS0CR)               [3092] Oh lord .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3093] Mm.
None (PS0CR)               [3094] But you know honestly, the mother's like Ken,
                           who do their children absolutely no, no, they're now
                           the proud owner's of three sons all of them, well
                           John's on his second marriage, Ken's on his second
                           marriage and [...] will be on his second marriage
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3095] Yep.
None (PS0CR)               [3096] and quite honestly, I think they not only do
                           they not bring them up to do, I mean useful like
                           that, but I thought Ken's [...] his family never
                           showed any affection any warmth, any caring, any
                           love, and I would do anything for anyone if they
                           just say thank you, but with Ken
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3097] My mother in law, was just, that, the other
                           way round.
                           [3098] She was drooling all over him
None (PS0CR)               [3099] Oh .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3100] in his fifties, it was my baby boy.
None (PS0CR)               [3101] Oh [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3102] It used to make you want to throw up
                           sometimes.
None (PS0CR)               [3103] Believe .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3104] I couldn't believe it when I first, first
                           year of marriage and when I got pregnant, er, we'd
                           walk into her, well it's her daughter's erm sitting
                           room, she'd struggle up out of an arm chair and I'd
                           think oh gosh, I know she mustn't get up for me, got
                           the tummy out here ,
None (PS0CR)               [3105] Yes .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3106] and the baby [...] have this chair, not her
                           pregnant daughter in law, but her baby boy.
None (PS0CR)               [3107] Oh god.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3108] All six foot of him.
None (PS0CR)               [3109] Oh poor little soul.
                           [3110] Oh Jesus how can you [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3111] No darling you mustn't do that, I'll shall,
                           I'll shall take your cup out .
None (PS0CR)               [3112] Let her get on with it?
                           [3113] Well I worked, he took me out
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3114] Yeah, but, I had to take over, where she left
                           off.
None (PS0CR)               [3115] I know, it is alarming isn't it?
                           [3116] I, it took me a long time, time to realise
                           that one can be [...] for a mug.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3117] otherwise the place was a tip.
None (PS0CR)               [3118] Oh yes, I used to live, we used to live in a
                           three bedroomed semi in [...] before we moved to our
                           present house, and one Christmas Ken said why don't
                           [...] all our family to us, which was his mother,
                           his father, his elder brother, his wife, two little
                           girls from them, Tony, Karen and their little one
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3119] God.
None (PS0CR)               [3120] [...] grandmother and I think there was an
                           aunt, and I said Ken were living in a three
                           bedroomed semi, oh they won't mind for Christmas.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3121] They won't mind.
None (PS0CR)               [3122] And they rang up, and they said were sending
                           you a list of what we expect to be available in the
                           way of food at Christmas because we always have the
                           same thing.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3123] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [3124] [...] , and I ended up virtually [...] people
                           in a fish tank.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3125] Yeah.
None (PS0CR)               [3126] And they all said now look is there anything
                           we can do and I said no, it's not, if you're coming
                           to me as far as I'm concerned I will do it, you need
                           anything and I will cope.
                           [3127] [...] not one of those females worked
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3128] Oh no.
None (PS0CR)               [3129] they were all at home all day I was
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3130] Oh no .
None (PS0CR)               [3131] the only one who worked full time, they came
                           on Christmas Eve with reluctant, because I said look
                           I'm sorry but I have to work Christmas Eve lunch
                           time, and they said right we'll be there at five
                           past one, and I finish at one, there were there at
                           five past one, they finally left two days after
                           Christmas because I said I'm sorry I have to go back
                           to work today.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3132] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [3133] Oh, oh, well we'd better go then, but we'll
                           come back next year because that was good I said no

                           Christmas
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3138] You should have said so and so could you come

None (PS0CR)               [3159] now that's what I [...] the family would do.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3160] the clearing up, they always gave a hand, but
                           even so, they, they didn't realise that the three
                           weeks before hand
None (PS0CR)               [3161] The sheer graft of trading round the shops,
                           getting it all in , humping it all home,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3162] The lists, the planning, the food .

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3167] My husband's eh, never bought the Christmas
                           presents, he buys one and usually he'd only get that
                           from one of the girls, what shall I get mum can you
                           do [...] .
None (PS0CR)               [3168] So he doesn't actually go out and do
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3169] He doesn't have to do anything, but about
                           four Christmas's ago I had the whole lot down, I had
                           nine of us for the whole Christmas week, erm, Boxing
                           Day I went in the kitchen, two of Diane's friends
                           had arrived, who lived in London and I went in the
                           kitchen, I'd had a bad dose of the flu virus that
                           was
None (PS0CR)               [3170] Oh ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3171] going around and I'd worked right through it
                           because of all the Christmas preparation
None (PS0CR)               [3172] we don't have another option do you?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3173] and I went into the kitchen and I fell down,
                           first time in my life, I've never passed out, not
None (PS0CR)               [3174] That's right ,

None (PS0CR)               [3176] mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3177] next thing I remember was being undressed and
                           in bed with Debbie standing there with a boiled egg
                           on a tray, saying mummy were so sorry you'll never
                           do Christmas again, you've done it for us for forty
                           years, we shall do it for you now.
None (PS0CR)               [3178] Oh, bless her cotton socks.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3179] And they have ever since.
None (PS0CR)               [3180] Oh bless them, and let them keep on doing it
                           .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3181] But there again you see I go in the kitchen
                           and say right, want to do spuds
None (PS0CR)               [3182] Here I am , shall I start on this, or do you
                           want me to do that, I know
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3183] Yeah , what would you like me to do?
None (PS0CR)               [3184] Yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3185] If, I say, if you want me out of the kitchen
                           just say so, I don't want to be under your feet .
None (PS0CR)               [3186] But if [...] absolutely you won't go quietly
                           , but
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3187] And they either say go and read the paper
                           mum, I'll call you in half an hour.
None (PS0CR)               [3188] Yes, and then you'll feel you don't want to
                           be [...] , yes absolutely, I know.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3189] And we get on fine .
None (PS0CR)               [3190] It takes you a long while to realise what a
                           twit you've been for so long.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3191] Yes.
                           [3192] Oh bless their hearts, they'd always helped,
                           but they hadn't realised I think .
None (PS0CR)               [3193] Yes but until you are the one who does it you
                           have no comprehension of what is involved.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3194] Yes, yes, Diane was the first
None (PS0CR)               [3195] This year I have my mummy and my daddy coming

                           same colour that's the trouble this time of year,
                           but no, life is a funny thing, and I find it
                           personally very hard to believe that only two months
                           ago, I mean what is it nine weeks ago, and I

None (PS0CR)               [3247] But you find that you can do things you've
                           never dreamt of.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3248] Yes.

None (PS0CR)               [3257] yes, and I sometimes think that way I know

                           wife number one and the way they are with wife
                           number two is a different world.

None (PS0CR)               [3348] Oh yes, I can understand that, but it's in
                           the same way as
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3349] assaulted in bushes ,
None (PS0CR)               [3350] you don't hate someone, because they have to
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3351] oh no I don't hate them.
None (PS0CR)               [3352] you don't hate someone cos they have
                           Leukaemia, you can't really hate someone
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3353] Oh no ,
None (PS0CR)               [3354] who has schizophrenia, they're, they're
                           because they've
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3355] no ,
None (PS0CR)               [3356] done something, because of the illness .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3357] I feel sorry for them there, but for the
                           grace of god, does anyone of us?
None (PS0CR)               [...]
Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3358] If they're sick in their heads , if they're
                           sick in their heads and they have to rape little
                           girls.
None (PS0CR)               [3359] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3360] But my first thought is for the little girls
None (PS0CR)               [3361] Oh yes, I [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3362] and I would stick a needle in their bottom
                           while they were fast asleep, so they didn't wake up
                           any more, just like you would with an animal that
                           does that.
None (PS0CR)               [3363] Mm, it's very easy to think that, until you
                           know them as people, I must admit, there are ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3364] Yes, I can see your point ,
None (PS0CR)               [3365] there is a hardcore, see, it's not
                           necessarily what they've done, but when you meet
                           them there's something instinctively repulsive about
                           them
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3366] yes.
None (PS0CR)               [3367] and not in, not necessarily the most
                           seriousness, something the way they look at you
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3368] Yeah.
None (PS0CR)               [3369] that to me is a hundred per cent unacceptable
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3370] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [3371] and you just think yuck
Ginny (PS0CG)              [...]
None (PS0CR)               [3372] and you have to try and cover over, you can't
                           say, god you're vile aren't you? [laugh] , but erm,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3373] Well I remember, so I used to talk to the
                           nurses quite a lot when I walked Roxanna, my other
                           German shepherd, in Wellington
None (PS0CR)               [3374] Yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3375] and quite a lot of the nurses used to walk
                           their nurses, I mean they're er war trained and
                           unarmed combat and they're wardens, let's face it,
                           they're not nurses, and one of them was saying to
                           me, oh we had a fellow in the other day, he'd, he'd
                           a, fallen up the police stations steps I think erm,
                           he said that he'd been to see the do gooders, he had
                           this interview
None (PS0CR)               [3376] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3377] and he convinced them he didn't need an
                           operation, he was, he was cured, he'd had his
                           treatment,psy psychiatrist that seen him and he was
                           all right thank you, he said, and they're so clever
                           they can convince anybody on the outside
None (PS0CR)               [3378] Oh yes, yes .
                           [3379] Yes we ask a psychopath now why [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3380] Exactly, and as they took him back to his
                           room, not his cell, but his room, he turned to my,
                           my mate who was with me and said er, I don't want an
                           operation I like having sex with little girls, he
                           said now I've got two little girls and I had to turn
                           and walk away
None (PS0CR)               [3381] [cough] mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3382] I said I can understand, he said I had to
                           turn and walk away because my fingers were itching
None (PS0CR)               [3383] Yes, I find it a lot easier actually not to
                           know what they've done, when you start work there
                           you tend to come over these cases, which [...] to do
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3384] Yeah.
None (PS0CR)               [3385] as much as anything, but it's only cos you're
                           writing a letter, and you say oh hello you writing a
                           letter to mum, he says no I killed her to come here,
                           you don't put your foot in it a big way, but after a
                           while because you know nobody there is nice it
                           really makes a lot of difference [...] people
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3386] [...] .
None (PS0CR)               [3387] you don't think oh here comes a rapist,
                           here's a sex offender, he's a whatever, just to take
                           them as they come as people, because you've got to
                           treat them all the same anyway
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3388] Yes, but this fellow you see, I said to him
                           erm, you had a lot to do with that fellow, he'd,
                           he'd been down to collect him from someone on the
                           South Coast as well with a police of course, and I
                           said what happened to the little girl? he said oh
                           she's been in psychiatric care, care for four years
None (PS0CR)               [3389] [...] oh yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3390] and there's no chance of her, and she was
                           shattered, her, her life was ruined .
None (PS0CR)               [3391] Oh their life's can be totally wrecked, I
                           don't doubt it for a moment.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3392] But I didn't have much sympathy for the man
                           who was
None (PS0CR)               [3393] There, there are those who it gives a [...]
                           going out and

                           years ago who talked to do gooders, that he was, he

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3397] and he was let out and first, within twenty
                           four hours he'd gone down to the South Coast and
                           killed his mother and his girl friend
None (PS0CR)               [3398] Yes, oh yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3399] just like that.

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3401] I mean I would, I would I'd stick a needle in
                           their bottoms just like I would for a dog that had
                           gone b , gone bad, I'd say poor creature can't help
                           it

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3403] I feel sorry for the victims
None (PS0CR)               [3404] There's a girl in there killed her daddy, but
                           whey did she kill daddy, she killed daddy because

None (PS0CR)               [3410] Who's, who's the wrong one there?.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3411] She shouldn't be in there.
None (PS0CR)               [3412] She needs help.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3413] She shouldn't be in there.
None (PS0CR)               [3414] Exactly, but I mean I rest my case, there's,
                           when you know their entire story, some of them, it
                           makes you wonder who's more sinning against than
                           sinning ... it's a strange affair.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3415] I think she had every right to [...] .

                           top window so there was indeed someone coming up the
                           drive, tore into the dinning room, picked up his
                           tennis ball, raced back to the window and wow, wow,
                           wow , with his ball in his mouth, and I said Henry

                           protective of me, because I'd given him a good home
                           and never, never hit him in the face .

                           the television, which he would, Politician, he'll
                           still go up and put his paws up on his knee, wag his

None (PS0CR)               [3491] Unbelievable.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3492] She would knife him if she had too, and then
                           of course she'd end up in Broadmoor,.
None (PS0CR)               [3493] We'd love to look after her you see.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3494] Yeah.

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3496] Yeah ,
None (PS0CR)               [3497] is not one of the emotions.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3498] I think there is sympathy erm for the people
                           who are sick of course I can .
None (PS0CR)               [3499] I think some, some of the illness are so
                           devastatingly terrified, that you can only think
                           thank god, not to have that, because it must be so
                           frightening, unlike some of these [...]

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3506] Yes.
None (PS0CR)               [3507] because if some of ours were in jail, they'd
                           be killed.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3508] Of course.
None (PS0CR)               [3509] Sex offenders, and rape little girls, hurt
                           policeman, they're not liked .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3510] They always get beaten up .
None (PS0CR)               [3511] They would never survive
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3512] Yeah, especially when it's their own little

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3549] It has, it has , it has.
None (PS0CR)               [3550] It's not all bad Ginny, it really isn't, and

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3559] and if it hadn't been for him I wouldn't have
                           them,
None (PS0CR)               [3560] Yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3561] mind you, I'd have somebody else's.
None (PS0CR)               [3562] [...] your girls are your daughters
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3563] Yes, but you know for years, when they were
                           growing up in their teens, I was the ... the tennis
                           net between him and his daughters, where's she
                           going, who's she going with, who's bringing her
                           home, is she wearing eye make up, why's she wearing

None (PS0CR)               [3564] Oh no ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3565] I was always the buffer between the two, I
                           used to say I agree with you dear, I don't want her
                           to wear nylons, that's not the point, all her
                           friends are wearing nylons and she's not going to be

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3567] odd one out.
None (PS0CR)               [3568] up on her own?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3569] She's not going to feel the odd one out.
None (PS0CR)               [3570] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3571] It doesn't make much difference to us, we're
                           not that hard up, that we can't afford
None (PS0CR)               [3572] So you're really getting it all along the
                           line aren't you?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3573] until they left home, first of all it was I
                           break his bloody neck taking advantage of my
                           daughter, cos they each lived with their
None (PS0CR)               [3574] Oh yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3575] boy, boy friends before, they married them,
                           they weren't sleep, if they'd been sleeping around
                           then I would of said something, then I would of said
                           something to them ,
None (PS0CR)               [3576] Something else, oh yes, yes .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3577] but it was one man and they stuck to him, and
                           they, they lived with them first and then they
                           married.
None (PS0CR)               [3578] Do you, honestly in this day and age I don't
                           think that's a really bad thing, because until
                           you're with someone all the time, who knows what,
                           you'd never have got in, you'd never have gone in
                           would you?.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3579] Only too, god if I [...] lived with him

Ginny (PS0CG)              [3581] No way, if I'd known him.
None (PS0CR)               [3582] [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3583] The whole courtship was a tissue of lies, you
                           know.
None (PS0CR)               [3584] Mm.

                           where he was born, what his parents did
None (PS0CR)               [3586] Really?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [3587] Everything was lies.

                           background, we'd known each other since we were

               after the weekend, you have nobody around and er, oh eh, it
               started bleeding.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3622] But it's natural for them to lick a wound.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3623] It is, but it opens it up
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3624] Yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3625] You see as it's quite nasty.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3626] Cos normally they aren't stitched, they have to heal by
               nature
Jackie (PS0CM) [3627] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3628] I suppose.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3629] He erm
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3630] What a good boy aren't you?
Jackie (PS0CM) [3631] and I thought oh what she gonna say, because he went
               yesterday afternoon
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3632] Yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3633] and she said, I told you he had been licking, she said
               oh, even with the licking, that's excellent I'm very pleased.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3634] Oh really has healed nice [...] .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3635] And she said he's not out of the woods yet, but, I'll
               give you a collar, if he's naughty, very crafty, [...] and then
               I looked through the crack in the door and his looking [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3636] But how can he reach it with the collar on?
Jackie (PS0CM) [3637] Well I
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3638] You've got the collar on back to front.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3639] I know, because he can still reach it the other way
               round.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3640] Oh, it should be [...] .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3641] Yes, I did, I put it on that way
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3642] And he could reach?.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3643] And he could, see he's got a little .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3644] It's so long isn't it?.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3645] Yes, this is it, you see, I don't think she thought of
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3646] Cos it's a [...] .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3647] Yeah, and even if, even
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3648] Got long under carriage, haven't you darling.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3649] [...] mummy he's still licking, [...] I thought what am I
               gonna do?
               [3650] So, I put it on the other way round this morning and he
               hates it, I've only just done it
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3651] Oh they do hate it.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3652] and he, he can't get round there [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3653] At least he can see , I mean Roxanna
Jackie (PS0CM) [3654] Yeah ,
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3655] had to have one for a short while, she was quite young
               and I, we'd only just moved here and I took her to the vet the
               used to be in Sandhurst, they said it was a bee sting, they put
               purple stuff on it
Jackie (PS0CM) [3656] oh.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3657] It didn't get any better and somebody told me about [...]
               and I took her down there, oh Mrs she's picked up mange, I said
               mange, I know she said you feel just like when your child's got
               nits in their hair
Jackie (PS0CM) [3658] Yeah
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3659] don't worry, it's, it's in the grass and she's just
               picked it up in the heat wave.
               [3660] So to stop it [...] cos she always used to clear the
               foxes from the top garden, but er, because she worried it, it
               was about there on her patch
Jackie (PS0CM) [3661] Oh yes, a niggle .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3662] a bald patch , yes, so she had wear, actually we had to
               cut down a plastic bucket cos she was a big dog
Jackie (PS0CM) [3663] Oh yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3664] cut down a plastic bucket and fixed that, it was great
               she had a bucket round her, round her
Jackie (PS0CM) [3665] Oh she'd only do that when
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3666] [...] thing .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3667] I sort of popping upstairs, when I'm here, I'll take it
               off him, but just now he, he was walking along like
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3668] Let him get used to it.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3669] as though he could walk, but when you came to the door,
               here [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3670] Yeah, yeah, he'd forgot all about it, didn't he, he was
               putting it on you see.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3671] [laugh] , yeah, yeah, this is it.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3672] They don't half get you at it, don't they?
Jackie (PS0CM) [3673] They do, they, they could wear you out.
               [3674] But he's eating well going to the loo alright.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3675] Good, I, I thought of you following him around watching
               what he was going to do.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3676] Oh my dear I was, it, you sort of feel exhausted with the
               worry of it don't you?
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3677] Yes and the
Jackie (PS0CM) [3678] And the strain.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3679] Of course you must of emptied his lower bowel, when she
               did the operation
Jackie (PS0CM) [3680] Yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3681] so there would of been nothing there for him to go for,
               you must of been ever so worried following him around watching
               him .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3682] I was , because I, I felt oh, if it all comes to pieces
               it's all gonna bleed
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3683] Yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3684] but he was alright and he didn't strain cos he couldn't
               go
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3685] Mm.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3686] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3687] Was there any way he
Jackie (PS0CM) [3688] And he's eating it alright.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3689] Oh good.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3690] I, I just put it on his dinner, cos there's no way that I
               squirt it in his mouth, I'd probably choke him.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3691] Yeah, yeah.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3692] I just put it on his dinner and he, he's licking all his
               bowls clean
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3693] Oh good.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3694] so, that it's working.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3695] So he's not off his food, that's a good sign.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3696] No.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3697] He's certainly alert, that's why I didn't want to ring
               the bell ,
Jackie (PS0CM) [3698] Yeah ,
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3699] so that he wouldn't upset himself by barking, that's why
               I tapped on the window when I saw you.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3700] [laugh] .
               [3701] There Herbie.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3702] What a good boy.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3703] Yeah, you're still not having [...] he says ,
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3704] What a good boy ,
Jackie (PS0CM) [3705] but he's quite bright eyed .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3706] he's aged , he's aged round he's eyes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3707] Yeah, ten and a half years old.
               [3708] Your [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3709] It doesn't seem that long since you had him as a puppy
Jackie (PS0CM) [3710] I know .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3711] use to keep
Jackie (PS0CM) [3712] This is the thing.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3713] keep Lancer company.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3714] Yeah, you did you perked Lancer up a treat didn't you?
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3715] Is there any way she can tell what's going on inside,
               where she did all the reconstruction.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3716] I suppose is the only way if, if he started bleeding or
               if he felt loose, cos she said he's still swollen from the
               operation
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3717] Yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3718] obviously, but he's, he's gone down, I, I can see he's
               gone down a little bit
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3719] Yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3720] I mean before he was all loose and baggy
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3721] That's right, he was.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3722] Were erm, where he had [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3723] And then of course he hasn't, he hasn't got testicles any
               more.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3724] No.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3725] But she's, so it's difficult to judge isn't it?
Jackie (PS0CM) [3726] Yes, yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3727] Cos you don't know how much she took away when she took
               the testicles out.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3728] No, he I mean he, he still got the little
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3729] They're partly inside, they're partly outside
Jackie (PS0CM) [3730] a little bag, but there's nothing in them [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3731] Yes, yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3732] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3733] She did a marvellous job.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3734] Yes, a [...] nurse came round and she said hello Herby,
               she said oh you look quite bright, and I said did he play you up
               she said well he was very torn and I thought yeah I'm sure he
               was .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3735] Oh poor little soul , of course he was.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3736] [...] in all night.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3737] Is he getting treats, is that why's he's looking
Jackie (PS0CM) [3738] No, I, I only give him his food .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3739] So that he get's a treat .
               [3740] Are you not getting any treats?
Jackie (PS0CM) [3741] And he's bowl of water.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3742] I nearly brought you down and treat, and I thought I'd
               better not until I've asked your mum.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3743] Yeah, he has had a bonio, he likes a bonio, he did eat
               one last night,
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3744] Well that's only
Jackie (PS0CM) [3745] he usually has a bonio after he's dinner
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3746] a food supplement isn't it?.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3747] this is it, but that's his sort of [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3748] Rocket has a chew usually .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3749] Oh yeah, got those.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3750] You know one of those hoof and horn chews
Jackie (PS0CM) [3751] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3752] Which there's nothing in them, there's noth , not
               fattening or anything.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3753] That's right.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3754] I mean I never have given my dogs chocolates or anything
               like that, a lot of people do .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3755] You now, he, he's had [...] , I'm just keeping him on the
               straight and narrow while he's on remission .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3756] Yes, oh yes .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3757] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3758] Yes, got to keep your insides in motion we have darling.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3759] [...] , she said he must not strain, and I've been
               petrified
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3760] I remember she was, she was ever so adamant about that.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3761] [yawn] she said straining is going to push the stitches
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3762] Yes
Jackie (PS0CM) [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3763] Yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3764] but as soon as he start, get ready, go, and I go up to
               Lisa's and [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3765] And he tells you when he wants to go, or is it regular
               times of the day?.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3766] Well he looks all peculiar .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3767] Yeah.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3768] [laugh] , I suppose like this morning after his
               breakfast, and he went and he, he, it was quite big
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3769] Good.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3770] So erm, I was pleased.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3771] Good, so it's forming into a proper form.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3772] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3773] Proper shape.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3774] Oh yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3775] But it's sliding with the, the liquid paraffin.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3776] It comes out quite good.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3777] Good, good, if it's forming properly that's a good sign
               isn't it of health, always.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3778] Yeah, cos, when he had he's hernia he, he's it used to
               come out flat.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3779] Yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3780] There's nothing there ,
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3781] Depressed ,
Jackie (PS0CM) [3782] you see, it's gone like that.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3783] yes.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3784] So erm, [...] round his bottom and it's all round know,
               and I keep looking for signs of bleeding and all this .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3785] Oh that's good, that means , that means their anal
               passage and his rectum were in the right shape again.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3786] That's right.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3787] Oh I'm so glad.
               [3788] Oh I hope so, but [...] still not out of the woods yet
               ...
Jackie (PS0CM) [3789] Erm, well no I suppose he won't be until he's erm, had
               stitches out, she said it would be two weeks
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3790] Mm.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3791] before we, you know, could really stop worrying.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3792] Mm, mm.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3793] But, she said I'm pleased with him so far, but we still
               got to be careful that's why she made him have this collar.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3794] Well remember I'm usually around, if I'm not there
Jackie (PS0CM) [3795] Thank you Ginny ,
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3796] the first time you ring, I'm usually only out long enough
               to walk the dog and do some shopping

               he goes
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3804] Yeah.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3805] like that, and she said oh, she said well I'm rather
               pleased to think that he feels likes doing it.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3806] Of course.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3807] [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3808] well that's the only way he can see out the window [...]

Ginny (PS0CG)  [3812] I often see him watching as I go by.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3813] That's right, he usually sits up there, and I'm, not
               going to leave him on his own till I know he's alright.
               [3814] But erm, she said don't worry too much about jumping, she
               said I'm quite pleased you know he can do that
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3815] Yeah.

               be alright to use.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3821] I suppose
Jackie (PS0CM) [3822] So
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3823] I suppose it's the same strength where ever you buy it.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3824] Well I can check on the bottle.
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3825] Yeah.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3826] [...] .

               they're trying to heal of course, they're pulling.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3834] Yeah, and with he's licking he's make it all soft and
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3835] That's why he's licking cos it must itch like made.
Jackie (PS0CM) [3836] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3837] [...] .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3838] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)  [3839] What a good boy, I would of thought she'd have put
               something on it, put some ointment on to stop it itching .
Jackie (PS0CM) [3840] And the other side is quite dry , yeah, that is the side
               he keeps on [...] but that's quite erm dry.

               couldn't have done any better, cos he gave him an antidote,
               before I new what it was I would have given him funny itching
               rash that was making the poor soul

Ginny (PS0CG) [4132] Thank you very much.
None (PS0CR)  [4133] No.
              [4134] There's not a lot of [...] . ...
Ginny (PS0CG) [4135] Not as cold ... not as cold yet as I thought it was going
              to be.
None (PS0CR)  [4136] No?
              [4137] Other people have been saying it's colder, colder than
              they thought. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4138] Well yesterday I thought it was. ...
None (PS0CR)  [...]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4139] Yes.
None (PS0CR)  [4140] [...] .

Ginny (PS0CG) [4147] Hello. ...
Turan (PS0CN) [4148] [...] very lucky if she'll give it to you.
              [4149] [laugh] . I haven't trained her yet. ... [...]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4150] Hello darling.
              [4151] Come and say hello.
              [4152] There's a love.
              [4153] Can't be left out can she?
Turan (PS0CN) [laugh] ...
Ginny (PS0CG) [4154] And bouncy there gets all the fuss doesn't she because
              she's so ... she's so full of life.
              [4155] But your an old love.
              [4156] Look at her [...] . ...
Turan (PS0CN) [4157] Yeah.
              [4158] You're always dopey aren't you?
              [4159] Eh?
Ginny (PS0CG) [4160] Oh she [...]
Turan (PS0CN) [4161] Suppose she's nice cos she's handier, don't have to bend
              down, [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4162] That's right.
              [4163] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4164] Sally!
              [4165] Now stop it.
              [4166] Gosh ... end of the walk.
              [4167] You should be tired.
              [4168] ... Ah.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4169] Well I'll have to have it if I want to throw it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4170] No she ... this is what she does.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4171] She wants you to chase her.
              [4172] I can't chase you I'm far too old.
              [4173] Ha ... got it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4174] [...] about three sticks on the way round so when we get
              here I've got one to throw.
              [4175] As she brings up one I've got another one to throw and she
              drops what she's got.
              [4176] And this is how we're going [...] .
              [4177] She's been playing with the [...] .
              [4178] I thought well that's good
Ginny (PS0CG) [4179] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4180] she doesn't need the extra ... belting around.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4181] Are you limping?
Turan (PS0CN) [4182] Erm ... my arthritis is playing me up this week.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4183] Ooh.
Turan (PS0CN) [4184] Don't know why.
              [4185] Whether ... what's caused it.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4186] Cold?
              [4187] ... A chill?
Turan (PS0CN) [4188] My other knee got bad all of a sudden.
              [4189] I mean I only had one bad knee but then this time I got
              two.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4190] Oh that's rough.
Turan (PS0CN) [4191] [laughing] It is [] .
              [4192] Sal!
              [4193] [shouting] Sally [] .
              [4194] You do not [...]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4195] I'll squeeze your paws.
              [4196] I will.
              [4197] I'll squeeze your paws. [...]
Turan (PS0CN) [4198] Now I keep trying that with you.
              [4199] ... oops [laugh] ... [...] Might be the weather.
              [4200] I don't know. [...]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4201] Have you strained?
Turan (PS0CN) [4202] I did [...] gardening.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4203] Oh.
Turan (PS0CN) [4204] Digging.
              [4205] Could have been that.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4206] Yes.
              [4207] ... Finds your weakest spots doesn't it?
Turan (PS0CN) [4208] It sure does.
              [4209] I'm not supposed to dig. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4210] Aren't you?
Turan (PS0CN) [4211] Not really no.
              [4212] Cos it aggravates the hip.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4213] Yes. [...]
Turan (PS0CN) [4214] [...] what annoys me cos I love gardening. ...
Ginny (PS0CG) [4215] I used to do, well I, I still do all, all the gardening
              that gets done.
              [4216] I used to spend hours gardening.
Turan (PS0CN) [4217] That's what I like.
              [4218] You go out there and you don't realize how long you've
              been out there.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4219] No.
              [4220] No you don't.
              [4221] I don't do so much now.
              [4222] I'm more a fair weather gardener.
Turan (PS0CN) [4223] Well I keep going out there trying to [laugh] keep the
              leaves down. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4224] That's impossible round here.
Turan (PS0CN) [4225] Well we've got an oak out the front ... and I've swept,
              I've got two bags [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG) [4226] Oh I can imagine.
Turan (PS0CN) [4227] The rest I've put in the gutter ... off the path and of
              course the wind's blown them all back off again. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4228] Yes.
              [4229] Yes.
              [4230] It's funny whichever way the wind blows ... my back door
              and my front door both get covered with leaves.
Turan (PS0CN) [4231] Yeah.
              [4232] I want
Ginny (PS0CG) [4233] It's magic.
Turan (PS0CN) [4234] really a continuous, strongish wind ... to blow in one
              direction for quite a few hours.
              [4235] It may blow them all into one spot. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4236] Yes.
              [4237] Never happens like that though does it?
Turan (PS0CN) [4238] We've got one corner of the garden out the front and if
              the wind's in the right direction it neatly puts them all
              together.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4239] Oh that's [...]
Turan (PS0CN) [4240] Cos the wall stops them.
              [4241] And they're much easier to pick up that way. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4242] That's right.
Turan (PS0CN) [4243] [cough] .
              [4244] But she's still got a load of leaves on her, the old oak.
              [4245] There's still a lot more to come.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4246] Yes.
              [4247] Oh yes there are.
              [4248] I saw a gadget the other day in a magazine.
              [4249] It was just like two dustbin lids.
              [4250] Pick up a heap of leaves at one point.
Turan (PS0CN) [4251] Oh yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4252] I thought well you could use dustbin lids instead of
              sending of ten pounds to get two of their pieces of [...]
Turan (PS0CN) [4253] I use my dust pan.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4254] Yes.
              [4255] Yes.
              [4256] I do.
Turan (PS0CN) [4257] Because that's smashing for just scooping up.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4258] Yes.
              [4259] And you can hold them with a ... with a brush or the
              broom.
Turan (PS0CN) [4260] Well I scooped it up and I got [...] there.
              [4261] You can always
Ginny (PS0CG) [4262] Yeah.
Turan (PS0CN) [4263] always wear rubber gloves anyway.
              [4264] So often I just scoop a [...] to put in.
              [4265] And I even use it when ... I wanna shift snow.
              [4266] ... I just, if it's a light snow
Ginny (PS0CG) [4267] Yes.
              [4268] That's a good idea.
Turan (PS0CN) [4269] I just scoop it up with that.
              [4270] I found it a lot easier [laugh] .
              [4271] I mean I bought a lovely wide broom.
              [4272] I thought oh that'll be smashing for the snow just sweep
Ginny (PS0CG) [4273] It's hard work.
Turan (PS0CN) [4274] And of course you do about a yard and then you're stuck.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4275] You can't move.
              [4276] No I find the best thing for snow cos ... we've got an
              eight car driveway so you can imagine how much
Turan (PS0CN) [4277] Yeah.
              [4278] That's like we have to.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4279] snow I have to shift.
              [4280] I get a thin, long board and use that.
Turan (PS0CN) [4281] It's definitely easiest.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4282] As long as the board itself isn't too heavy.
Turan (PS0CN) [4283] Well this is it.
              [4284] I have to, cos with the ... with the pan although I'm
              bending, it's, it's not too bad because it's not too heavy for
              me.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4285] Yes.
              [4286] Well I get a board about here ... and just walk and push.
Turan (PS0CN) [4287] Oh right.
              [4288] It's alright, somebody had their windsc erm window smashed
              yesterday.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4289] I know.
              [4290] A gentleman stopped me as I was coming back and he said
              ... do you own a white Austin Metro.
              [4291] And it's funny because the last car that I saw the
              fellow's from ... I saw the fellow's who did it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4292] Oh you did?
Ginny (PS0CG) [4293] And got their car number.
              [4294] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4295] Oh you have?
Ginny (PS0CG) [4296] And the police came and interviewed me about it.
              [4297] That was a white Austin Metro.
              [4298] Don't think it's the same young woman.
              [4299] ... He said oh the car's been broken into [...]
Turan (PS0CN) [4300] No because it was funny cos we were talking ... to the
              lady.
              [4301] She's got a red setter.
              [4302] And ... she'd just arrived.
              [4303] And she apparently [...] .
              [4304] She said, do you know she said we'd gone off to the woods
              and I suddenly ... remembered I'd left my purse in the car.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4305] Oh no.
Turan (PS0CN) [4306] She said so I went back and got my purse.
              [4307] ... She said now ... apparently they've got a horse
              somewhere round here and she said when she came back there was
              this car about half hour later after they'd left here ... a car
              been broken into.
              [4308] She said er it makes me wonder if I'd left my purse in the
              car if it had of been our car that might have been dumped.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4309] Yeah.
Turan (PS0CN) [4310] Well ... they'd gone off and before ... Anthea had gone
              and I was still fiddling about getting the windows clean.
              [4311] This car drew in there and a chap got out and I thought,
              what dog's he got?
              [4312] You know [...]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4313] That's what I always think.
              [4314] I look for the dog or the jogging suit and if they haven't
              got a dog or a jogging suit ... I think what are they up to?
Turan (PS0CN) [4315] Well see he, he was quite tall and when he got out he was
              a bit scruffy looking, and his shirt was hanging out below his
              jacket.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4316] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4317] And he got out [whispering] I can't see any dog [] .
              [4318] But he walked very purposefully erm straight up there and
              then I noticed he'd got a hook
Ginny (PS0CG) [4319] Yes?
Turan (PS0CN) [4320] instead of a right hand.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4321] That's useful for breaking into things isn't it?
Turan (PS0CN) [4322] And I, and I thought to myself ... oh no perhaps he's
              legitimate.
              [4323] [laughing] He's just going for a walk [] .
Ginny (PS0CG) [4324] No it's odd.
Turan (PS0CN) [4325] But it's a maroony ... dirty maroony ... and black I think
              it was car.
              [4326] And it was a W M X, the letters were.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4327] Didn't you tell the police?
              [4328] You should give them a ring and tell them if you saw a
              strange man.
Turan (PS0CN) [4329] Well yeah I did I mean he disappeared from sight whereas
              the others
Ginny (PS0CG) [4330] Well he would if you were waiting around here.
              [4331] Of course you look as though
Turan (PS0CN) [4332] Ah I dunno.
              [4333] One morning when I came here there was a car arrived here
              and it was a ... a dirty yellow one and thr two women and a bloke
              got out all dressed in ... black jeans and black jumpers.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4334] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4335] So I thought now that's odd.
              [4336] They didn't look the sort to go ... for a ramble
Ginny (PS0CG) [4337] [...] perhaps.
Turan (PS0CN) [4338] And they come out and they sort of were looking around ...
              and there was a load of cars here.
              [4339] And I thought I don't like the look of that.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4340] Mm.
Turan (PS0CN) [4341] So I was standing there and I thought to myself pretend
              I'm looking at my watch and I'm waiting for someone.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4342] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4343] And they hung about and hung about and then they came
              across here, looked at the board and they kept turning round and
              looking where I was.
              [4344] And I was still hanging there.
              [4345] Then they walked down there, but not out of sight ... of
              the cars.
              [4346] Then they came back, read the notice board again.
              [4347] I must have been there about five or ten minutes?
Ginny (PS0CG) [4348] [...] neat haircuts?
Turan (PS0CN) [4349] They looked quite ... quite presentable.
Ginny (PS0CG) [...]
Turan (PS0CN) [4350] One woman was very fat.
              [4351] ... And I still stood there so I got in the car and wrote
              the number down.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4352] Good for you.
Turan (PS0CN) [4353] Cos I thought I'm never gonna remember it.
              [4354] And eventually they got in and went off.
              [4355] But they were, they kept on looking at me to see if I was
              gonna move and I thought I'm not gonna move till you move.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4356] Mm.
Turan (PS0CN) [4357] Cos the fact that they only went down there, came back and
              were milling around ... waiting I wouldn't have been a bit
              surprised cos the car was a filthy old car.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4358] You should have told you should have told the police.
              [4359] Any car number you can
Turan (PS0CN) [4360] They hadn't done anything.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4361] No.
              [4362] But any car number you can get if they're acting
              suspiciously please tell them.
              [4363] That's what they keep telling me.
Turan (PS0CN) [4364] Oh I see.
              [4365] Cos they had er
Ginny (PS0CG) [4366] Because they came and interviewed me.
              [4367] If you see anything suspicious.
              [4368] The last time I phoned up I said ... the bicycle that was
              hidden in the bushes.
              [4369] Obviously been stolen.
              [4370] Down there ... that erm Davey and I found together.
              [4371] His dog erm found it, you know Sam?
              [4372] Erm ... next day it was still there ... although he'd
              phoned the police.
              [4373] So I phoned them up in the afternoon and I said the
              bicycle that ... my friend Mr reported yesterday afternoon is
              still in the bushes.
              [4374] I said and I have a feeling that there was somebody there
              watching me ... I could feel it.
              [4375] I said and as I came back up what I call the straight path
              parallel with the road there were two men loitering in the bushes
              against the car park.
Turan (PS0CN) [4376] Oi!
Ginny (PS0CG) [4377] Both very well dressed.
              [4378] Jeans, but clean and spruce and I said ... I have a
              feeling they could have been police.
              [4379] And he burst out laughing and said you're quite right
              madam, they were police.
Turan (PS0CN) [4380] No these didn't give me the feeling of being police.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4381] No.
              [4382] But there's one I thought how stupid.
              [4383] It's alright to park erm a non police car but there was a
              policeman actually sitting in the car while two of them loitered
              in there.
              [4384] They were obviously staking out the place.
              [4385] But while there's a man sitting respectably in a car no-
              one's gonna break into the other cars.
Turan (PS0CN) [4386] I know.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4387] Not if they're witnessed, are they?
Turan (PS0CN) [4388] No I mean because I mean erm
Ginny (PS0CG) [4389] So the other police should have gone into the other ...
              should have gone away somewhere.
Turan (PS0CN) [4390] I didn't ... I didn't cotton on to these two er these
              three.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4391] And yet you feel uneasy?
Turan (PS0CN) [4392] Erm ... it was the way they sort of checked all the way
              round the car park as if they were looking to see which would be
              the best.
              [4393] And I mean they did get out and have a little mooch around
              the car park.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4394] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4395] And I thought to myself no I'm not gonna go out, I did
              start to go out the park and I thought no.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4396] Yeah.
              [4397] I'm like you.
Turan (PS0CN) [4398] Because ... what if ... they do break in.
              [4399] Perhaps I'm, I'm misjudging but perhaps ... what if they
              did, how would I feel?
Ginny (PS0CG) [4400] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4401] So I thought no I'll wait and see.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4402] Oh you should give the police that number.
              [4403] Just to be on the safe side.
Turan (PS0CN) [4404] I've lost it now cos I've chucked the matchbox out.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4405] Oh what a shame.
Turan (PS0CN) [4406] But it was a yellow car and it had like soft toys and that
              in the back.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4407] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4408] On the back window ledge.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4409] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4410] Cos I thought to myself well I'll never remember the make
              of car.
              [4411] I mean I'm, I'm hopeless with cars.
              [4412] But I thought to myself oh you do ... you do look
              suspicious.
              [4413] And then I was talking to somebody about this and ... they
              and they burst out laughing and said well we've got a friend, a
              male friend ... [...] a mate of mine he said and he loves
              walking.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4414] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4415] He said and what he often does ... is because he lives
              over this area.
              [4416] He'll often cut through ... this way to go over to
              Wellington into Crowthorne and walk all the way round.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4417] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4418] He said he often walks through the woods on his own.
              [4419] [laughing] I had to laugh.
              [4420] He must forgive us ladies [...] do a sidestep [] .
              [4421] He said he is legitimate.
              [4422] He just loves walking.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4423] Oh yes.
              [4424] But the police would much rather you told them ... when
              there's no
Turan (PS0CN) [4425] Yes.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4426] nothing to be ... nothing wrong with it than that you
              didn't tell them and there might be something wrong with it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4427] Oh I'll have to keep my eyes open.
              [4428] Cos I thought well the couple had only just walked up
              there and I thought to myself oh well ... he might meet up with
              them, you know.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4429] The young, the young officer who came to me he said ... of
              course we're so glad you got the number, you're quite right it's
              a car that's been doing the same thing in Wokingham.
              [4430] We only know that they live somewhere in the Wokingham
              area.
              [4431] It's lads who earn their living at this.
Turan (PS0CN) [4432] Yeah, yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4433] They go from car park to car park.
              [4434] He said er but of course the thing is they don't expect
              elderly ladies ... to notice their car numbers and remember them.
              [4435] Now I may not remember always the make ... first glance
              off unless I look at it.
              [4436] But this was an eastern European car so they didn't expect
              me to know the make.
              [4437] But I do remember numbers.
Turan (PS0CN) [4438] Oh I've got a terrible memory.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4439] And I scratched it on there to make sure that I didn't
              forget it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4440] Oh I see.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4441] And as soon as I got home I wrote it down.
              [4442] I put it on there with my key.
              [4443] ... # or whatever it was.
              [4444] It's probably still there now.
              [4445] It is ... it's still there.
              [4446] ... . It's still there.
Turan (PS0CN) [4447] Oh this was ... this was ... er W M X.
              [4448] I remembered that because ... what did it remind me of?
              [4449] W M X. ...
Ginny (PS0CG) [4450] Like a B M X bike I expect.
Turan (PS0CN) [4451] Yeah or a volk volkswagen or something.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4452] Mm.
Turan (PS0CN) [4453] Something clicked as I looked at the number.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4454] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4455] It's like with a lot of number plates.
              [4456] Sometimes it ... oh that's so and so's.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4457] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4458] I mean a lot of mine I can't even remember me own number
              plate.
Ginny (PS0CG) [laugh]
Turan (PS0CN) [4459] But I [...] .
              [4460] No I went back and got in the car and was fiddling about
              and I wrote it down on a matchbox you see.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4461] Yes good idea.
Turan (PS0CN) [4462] But the funny thing is by the time I got home I still
              remembered it.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4463] Yes.
              [4464] Cos you'd written it down.
              [4465] If you hadn't written it down you wouldn't have.
Turan (PS0CN) [4466] No.
              [4467] Er this is, I mean I've just got that way.
              [4468] I thought to myself well if I don't write it down now ...
              cos that's why I got back in my car.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4469] You should have told the police ... they'd have been
              interested.
Turan (PS0CN) [4470] Oh well then, another time then I'll remember that.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4471] Cos you see I said why, why can't you trace the car?
              [4472] I mean the number's quite, I said you, you reaffirmed that
              the number was the same one that had been doing the same thing
              in, in Wokingham.
              [4473] He said ... the car belonged to an elderly lady in
              Wokingham.
              [4474] We've traced it that far.
              [4475] She had sold it and she hadn't told the erm Swansea
              people, you know?
Turan (PS0CN) [4476] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4477] The vehicle licensing people.
              [4478] It's so easy to just write the slip ... and say I've sold
              my car to mister so and so.
              [4479] I always do it.
              [4480] Erm ... and then that person she'd sold it to she knew
              their address.
              [4481] They went to him and he had sold it as well and they
              couldn't
Turan (PS0CN) [4482] Yeah cos since they've done away with the log book.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4483] And it hadn't been registered.
Turan (PS0CN) [4484] Where you used to have to send the
Ginny (PS0CG) [4485] Exactly.
Turan (PS0CN) [4486] log book in and it would come back.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4487] It hadn't been registered so they'd got, the police have
              got no way of tracing it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4488] No.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4489] Except keep driving round Wokingham looking for it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4490] I mean they ... at least they could pick you up cos they'd
              had the log book.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4491] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4492] In the old days.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4493] Yeah.
              [4494] It was good wasn't it?
Turan (PS0CN) [4495] Yeah.
              [4496] And each car they knew where they were didn't they?
Ginny (PS0CG) [4497] That's right.
              [4498] And the previous owner and the previous owner.
Turan (PS0CN) [4499] That's it.
              [4500] Cos it was all written down.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4501] Yes. ...
Turan (PS0CN) [4502] Oh all these [...] barred stuff.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4503] They've got everything on computers now and it doesn't
              work half the time does it?
Turan (PS0CN) [4504] [laugh] Well it's only as good as the person putting it
              in.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4505] Yeah too true.
Turan (PS0CN) [4506] That's what they used to say.
              [4507] Still [...] human error. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4508] Yes.
              [4509] Oh yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4510] Until you get a computer for computing a computer. [laugh]

Ginny (PS0CG) [4511] Yes.
              [4512] With a mind of it's own.
              [4513] An intelligence.
Turan (PS0CN) [4514] That's what I mean.
              [4515] Then that's frightening.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4516] Yes.
              [4517] It is isn't it?
Turan (PS0CN) [4518] Oh I couldn't take that.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4519] Well.
              [4520] I love your accent.
              [4521] Where do you come from?
Turan (PS0CN) [4522] Me?
              [4523] Originally ... London.
              [4524] Chiswick.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4525] I wouldn't ... don't hear any London.
Turan (PS0CN) [4526] Erm ... well ... sometimes it might come out is a bit of
              Devonshire.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4527] Devonshire?
              [4528] Yes.
              [4529] That's what it is.
Turan (PS0CN) [4530] I only spent six years of my childhood there during the
              war years.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4531] Well I can hear it.
              [4532] It's a lovely soft ... soft accent.
Turan (PS0CN) [4533] Oh thank you.
              [4534] Very proud of being Devon
Ginny (PS0CG) [4535] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4536] from Devon.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4537] Yes.
Turan (PS0CN) [4538] I expect, cos when I came back from there nobody could
              understand me.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4539] Oh.
Turan (PS0CN) [4540] When I went back to London.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4541] My youngest daughter's there now.
              [4542] Plymouth.
              [4543] Well outside of Plymouth.
              [4544] Little village.
Turan (PS0CN) [4545] Yeah I was at Dartmouth.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4546] Yeah it's lovely isn't it?
Turan (PS0CN) [4547] Oh it was gorgeous.
              [4548] After I was there for six years
Ginny (PS0CG) [4549] Yes?
Turan (PS0CN) [4550] I wouldn't come home. [laugh]
Ginny (PS0CG) [4551] I can, I can hear it softly.
              [4552] It's beautiful.
              [4553] I like it.
Turan (PS0CN) [4554] I just wouldn't come home.
              [4555] ... My mum tried bribery, everything.
              [4556] ... I hated Lon er, well Chiswick it was sort of
Ginny (PS0CG) [4557] I hate London.
Turan (PS0CN) [4558] Chiswick, Acton.
Ginny (PS0CG) [4559] Oh I.

                           prefer older people cos youngest like that are
                           inclined try to put their music on a bit loud or
                           invite their friends in when mum's away, you know,
                           and [...] .

                           like this, and he didn't want that, you see, so,
                           erm, but, in one hand he's saying buy me anything
                           and the other hand he's saying I don't like this and

Vicky (PS0CK)              [4792] I looked at the illustration and I thought no

                           you can push the turner things into chips then
                           you've only got to chop them one way if you see what
                           I mean, like erm, well is it worth these doing
                           anything else?
Ginny (PS0CG)              [4818] But why , [...] chop.
Vicky (PS0CK)              [4819] I mean, what else would you use it for?
                           [4820] Do you use it to slice? or to grate? or to
                           erm

Vicky (PS0CK)              [4830] But there's nothing in there to say it's from

                           Level cos her father had one and she feels that is
                           she could get and English A Level it would impress
                           him, he, she spends her life trying to impress her
                           father who doesn't really takes much notice of her,
                           [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5564] Yeah.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5565] And she started off quite well there, she was
                           a little bit erm lonely and missed her [...] and
                           everything but she gave the appearance sticking it
                           out until I spoke to Mary last time when she said oh
                           [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5566] She must of got a grant.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5567] She, she's there on Social Security which
                           means she can only do part time education because if
                           you're on the Social Security you have to [...]
                           available to do a job
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5568] Yes.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5569] so that
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5570] Which is reasonable isn't it?
Keith (PS0CH)              [5571] yes, so, so, that you can only do education
                           part time.
                           [5572] So Mary said she, she came back up to the, a
                           little while ago she said she didn't get [...] do
                           something
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5573] Mm, mm.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5574] and even an English A Level's not much good
                           to her, yet she [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5575] She should do what Dinda done, I mean Dinda
                           went to evening school for her computer
Keith (PS0CH)              [5576] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5577] A Level while she was working during the day
Keith (PS0CH)              [5578] Mm.
                           [5579] This is, this is it.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5580] Paid for her to help [...] .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5581] [...] .

                           the moment, is work in a shop or a restaurant or
                           something like that and she doesn't get paid as much
                           as she'll get on Social Security so it's not worth
                           it,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5583] It's terrible.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5584] it's terrible, [...] awful [...] showing her
                           sense of responsibility and doing what she says
                           she's going to do.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5585] Wouldn't she of done better to take erm a six
                           month's course in secretarial skills?
Keith (PS0CH)              [5586] Well Mary said if I thought for a minute that
                           she would stick at it, I would pay for her [...] but

Ginny (PS0CG)              [5587] Yes, yes .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5588] she won't, she's, she's just on the, oh I

                           because they don't they don't need shorthand
                           nowadays ,
Keith (PS0CH)              [5592] Really don't need that now, no .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5593] but I find it useful.

                           typing and computing don't they, doesn't [...]

                           video, video camera,
Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [5621] they do say that, that one
Keith (PS0CH)              [5622] microwave
Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [5623] people don't seemed to have cut
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5624] No.

                           is a luxury really.
Unknown speaker (KC9PSUNK) [5626] Most people are buying those sort of things
                           [...] ...
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5627] I know it's [...] one of the last things I'd
                           would [...]
Keith (PS0CH)              [5628] Vacuum cleaner, yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5629] Mm.
                           [5630] Having been through the spate of using a
                           clapped out vacuum cleaner that didn't do its job,
                           and how different it is now
Keith (PS0CH)              [5631] Yes ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5632] that I've got one that works.

Keith (PS0CH)              [5636] It was the only thing they had, they'd got
                           nothing except [...] , I think it was [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5637] I didn't get a vacuum cleaner.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5638] [...] , we, we got our washing machine [...]
                           washing machine, remember it, we used to bolt it to
                           the floors
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5639] Yes, yes.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5640] we, we weren't allowed to have that one,
                           until we could pay for it outright.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5641] Yes.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5642] [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5643] Didn't have a fridge.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5644] No, no.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5645] Not until after we
Keith (PS0CH)              [5646] [...] no ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5647] moved to Maidenhead.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5648] not until you could pay for it [...] , you
                           didn't do, go [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5649] Remember my washing machine where I used to
                           turn the handle at the top, heat it up with gas
Keith (PS0CH)              [5650] Yeah, [...] , yeah, yeah .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5651] and if I'd got something big and heavy you
                           used to say to me bring it down and put it in my big
                           machine.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5652] Mm ...
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5653] I used to bring down quilts and [...] ... my
                           machine wasn't big enough and in any case I couldn't
                           possibly lift them once they were
Keith (PS0CH)              [5654] No, no ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5655] full of water.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5656] no, but nowadays the, the machines don't take
                           [...] , mind you because it was [...] take a lot of
                           water, waste [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5657] Mm.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5658] Nowadays it's
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5659] Don't they, don't they have [...]
Keith (PS0CH)              [5660] I know, I know if I've got a towel in mine or
                           a big thing and, and it's all happens to be on one
                           side
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5661] One side ,
Keith (PS0CH)              [5662] of the, the drum and it starts to erm ...
                           spin
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5663] yeah
Keith (PS0CH)              [5664] the whole thing goes woof and it all seems
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5665] Really .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5666] to move to one side, yeah, cos it's standing
                           in an area and it isn't flat against [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5667] That seems rather [...] something heavy.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5668] Mm, mm, [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5669] Yes.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5670] [laugh] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5671] But I often look back and think well if was
                           the girls who insisted that it's time mum had a
                           proper automatic washing machine
Keith (PS0CH)              [5672] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5673] and then only had it four years, but I used
                           to [...] it was, it's such a waste that washing
                           machine, I think maybe I've done a few shirts [...]
                           hand washing and all the [...] water, whereas in the
                           twin tub I'd of done the light weights, heated the
                           water up done the shirts and [...] , erm, got the
                           [...] put in, maybe towels and then I'd put, re-heat
                           the water if, if it wasn't really soiled and I could
                           do either all the dogs stuff or, or my dusters
Keith (PS0CH)              [5674] Yeah, mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5675] and then after that you've got all the water
                           left and it cleaned the sink as you as the pump
                           pumped it out, you could go quickly with a brush
                           round the sink and suds cleaned all the sink for
                           you, or you could with your [...] pail.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5676] Yeah, or, or even with the garden [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5677] Oh yes, I used to save it for the garden too.
                           [...] ... [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5678] Now, now, with it, the one thing in that's
                           it, and all the water's wasted, you can't re-use it
                           for anything.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5679] No.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5680] I suppose I could if I could pull the machine
                           out and were, were the pipe goes over into the waste
                           ... I mean people do that in the Isle of Wight
                           aren't they, were they've got to, need to
Keith (PS0CH)              [5681] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5682] they unhook their washing machine

                           with the ten P pieces to put in and then when it was
                           full up he'd empty it out and give them all ten P
                           pieces back

                           imagine that's written off against it.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5836] Well he, he said if they, if, if, some, get a
                           visitor in and I give them a cup of coffee well
                           that's all right, but [...] I don't know if it's
                           money or, or like maybe, maybe [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5837] But it seems to me [...] it's the person,
                           people drinking the coffee who are getting the perk,
                           therefore they should have twenty pounds a year
                           added for ... free coffee providers
Keith (PS0CH)              [5838] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5839] worth twenty pounds a year or whatever it is
                           worth
Keith (PS0CH)              [5840] Well he [...] he was saying that, that the
                           boss was the one that provided the money that the
                           chap was [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5841] So he, that was definite, yeah.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5842] If he was given them tokens or something like
                           that, it would of been alright, but I, I, I [...] a
                           couple of weeks ago
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5843] Perhaps now they're not doing it then .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5844] I've forgotten the details on it .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5845] Well imagine what Panasonic are going to own
Keith (PS0CH)              [5846] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5847] giving out those great big blocks of [...] ,

                           so that, don't know anything else about it because

Ginny (PS0CG)              [5853] Yes , and he hadn't even earned that had he?
Keith (PS0CH)              [5854] [laughing] not a chance, he, he never even
                           earned that much money in all his [laugh] [] , no
                           but I mean having, having had the income tax done

Keith (PS0CH)              [5858] The [...] finally he decided what [...] he
                           had to right back to say, you know, I, I, tell you
                           this is how much I've earned
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5859] Yeah
Keith (PS0CH)              [5860] this is how much tax I've paid, this is, I
                           mean if you go on the dole too unless you've made a
                           note of it there is no record of how much you've
                           been paid on the dole, they, they give John the what
                           he calls a giro, takes it to the bank and cashes it
                           and there is no, no record of [...] and when he's
                           been on the dole.
                           [5861] I mean he's got plenty of [...] every single
                           bit of papers that they're given all the time.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5862] Yeah , but the D S S must have it, [...] .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5863] Well I, I don't know how keen they are on
                           giving them out, just [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5864] [...] .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5865] Actually it was lucky for us because when
                           John rang up ... the
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5866] For his firm.
Keith (PS0CH)              [5867] for his firm, erm, he said [...] I'll, I will
                           see to it, which she's doing at the moment but [...]
                           , but erm, I don't know how far
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5868] At least it's got an end now with the others
                           if he's on the film company, he's got an end now
                           hasn't he now he's got [...] .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5869] Yes I suppose so, but I feel sorry for Simon
                           cos you see John and Geoff they can both go on the
                           dole but Simon's is [...] .
                           [5870] The [...] or, or anything so at the moment
                           [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5871] [...] .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5872] Any way the thing is erm, I hope [...] only
                           have a [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [...]
Keith (PS0CH)              [5873] What he's, he's earns, er pay tax on
                           everything he's earned
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5874] Yeah
Keith (PS0CH)              [5875] never had a [...] not for all the things
                           [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5876] No, no
Keith (PS0CH)              [5877] and er, he's been on the dole admittedly he
                           did go on the dole [...] If you're on the dole for
                           part of the year, your own salary is [...] do they
                           add your dole money to the salary, charge you tax on
                           that ,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5878] Oh yes, oh not half
Keith (PS0CH)              [5879] you see so I think,
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5880] not half
Keith (PS0CH)              [5881] I said to Paddy I think that they do that
                           John will owe, owe them some money cos he'll owe
                           them tax from all the doles [...] .
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5882] he can't tell them how much it is?
Keith (PS0CH)              [5883] Because er, I don't know whether
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5884] Oh well that [...] signature for it every
                           time and it goes on his file every one has a file .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5885] Well I hope so , because he's been when he
                           went [...]
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5886] Huh.
                           [5887] He didn't get very much [...] .
Keith (PS0CH)              [5888] So I, I don't think it's finished yet
                           somehow, he don't seemed worried about it [...] ...
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5889] It seems that they chase somebody like John
                           who, at the outside may end up after five years
                           owing them perhaps a hundred to two hundred pounds
Keith (PS0CH)              [5890] Mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5891] and yet people like the Maxwell board
Keith (PS0CH)              [5892] Yeah, yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5893] millions involved and other people who are
                           running dodgy companies
Keith (PS0CH)              [5894] Yeah.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5895] going bankrupt and then starting up another
                           company in another name
Keith (PS0CH)              [5896] Mm, mm
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5897] which I don't think should be allowed, go
                           right themselves off and leave lots of people that
                           they owe money to and can't get it, they get
                           threatened
Keith (PS0CH)              [5898] That's right and then they go and start again

Ginny (PS0CG)              [5899] in the [...] or something, it's [...] some of
                           them are [...] all over again, start them off of
                           course.

Ginny (PS0CG)              [5905] he said and I got on very well with them,
                           have a chat and I used to help them when they came
                           in [...] they were West Indians which gave everybody
                           a bit of a shock when [...] running a local Spa
Keith (PS0CH)              [5906] Yes.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5907] [...] , but erm, [...] and I notice that
                           quite often the shelves would be half empty, [...]
                           came here, I would stop on the way back from the
                           school [...] the bank and the butcher's and the
                           paper shop over the road I could come in quarter to
                           nine and I'm, you know, I, I was done and I said to
                           my Arnold they're not going to sell much unless they
                           put some money into filling the shelves surely Spa
                           will back them, and he said I keep on telling them
                           that I keep on saying to them if you don't put the
                           goods there on display people are going to go over
                           the road to Lipton's and [...] and
Keith (PS0CH)              [5908] Mm, mm.
Ginny (PS0CG)              [5909] eventually they went bankrupt, Florrie is an

                           she always enjoyed it, she's been there say twenty

                           fifteen months none of their part time staff had
                           their stamps put on their cards, so for their, for

Ginny (PS0CG) [6411] Cold over the meadow then.
Keith (PS0CH) [6412] Do you know how, if you've got a lot of toadstools and

Keith (PS0CH) [6414] That little pouch in the front where I have flowers in, in
              the summer, absolutely covered in toadstools, it's all the way

              [6415] What, what I do?
Ginny (PS0CG) [6416] They're probably edible.
Keith (PS0CH) [6417] Oh dear, the thing is, as, as far as I can remember I

              grow up again.
Keith (PS0CH) [6425] Unfortunately I haven't got any spare earth to put it .
Ginny (PS0CG) [6426] I've got an idea I read that salt [...] of course kitchen
              salt [...] does it, which I imagine would kill most any thing.
Keith (PS0CH) [6427] Well yes.
Ginny (PS0CG) [6428] [...] .
Keith (PS0CH) [6429] Yes, and it might kill the flowers off, but [...] .

Keith (PS0CH) [6433] yes
Ginny (PS0CG) [6434] interlaced mats

Keith (PS0CH) [6446] Well we dug the lot up [...] they're all growing like mad
              and I, I've got an idea that once you've moved them they don't,
              they don't re-settle very well.
Ginny (PS0CG) [6447] Oh I thought you can move bulbs any time when they were
              dormant.
