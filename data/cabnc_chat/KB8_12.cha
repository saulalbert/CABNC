*JAM:	Mhm. •642342_642482•
*BIL:	and he's, he's just  you know what I mean, I think he's, he's getting an extension so that's why there's a bit of delay on that. •642492_648242•

*ANN:	drakes er chasing one duck  er, just past the baths along the promenade. •664252_669112•
        And then we sat  at the far side of the Old Gate bridge  and er  an old lady came along  and said, and she was counting them  but she said, just look at that thing, she counted seven  although, in actual fact, by then  these the seven drakes had stopped chasing the duck and they were all sitting down. •669232_694562•
        And there was a domestic one  in each group  there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was another white one  near Old Gate Bridge. •695132_706282•
*JAM:	Did he cull them as well? •706442_707802•

*JAM:	That's right. •724502_726282•
*BIL:	and, somebody erm  nobody really knew a great deal about it, so I think he's been doing some research on that. •726282_731542•
        That's the one paper that is a bit er  maybe a bit so  but I'll have to check with the N  R A because of course er, the river •732192_742792•
