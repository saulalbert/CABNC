*DOR:	Mm.  (.) I presume so. 
*AND:	Why is not on a  (  ) ? 
*DOR:	Well they didn't tell us why.  (.) Just said it wasn't.  (.) I think they're just a bit shortstaffed because   (.) the girl that's usually in there hasn't been in there for weeks, Josie. They've had the girl that's normally in there on a Saturday   (.) during the week.  (.) Perhaps she's ill. (.)  
*CHR:	What did you say?  (6.0) What did you say mother? 
*DOR:	I said there's normally a different lady in the   (.) in the library. 
*CHR:	For what? 
*DOR:	On a Monday. The lady that was in there today   (.) not Rosie the one that does the stories, she's always there   (.) well, when she's there. The other lady, Josie, she's normally   (.) in there. But she hasn't been there for a few weeks now so I think she might be ill. Or on holiday or something. No she can't be on holiday all that length of time. 
*CHR:	She's back now. ((laugh))  
*DOR:	No she wasn't today. There was a lady there but that's the lady that normally goes on a Saturday. 
*CHR:	But why didn't she go on a Saturday then? 
*DOR:	Well I suppose she does go on a Saturday as well. They probably had to rake her in to   (.) hold the fort. 
*CHR:	I expect she didn't go  (  ) . 
*DOR:	I don't know. 
*CHR:	Why? 
*DOR:	I don't know whether she did or not. (.)
