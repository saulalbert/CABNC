*COR:	Well Terry came down last night. •_•
*ALB:	Well  •_•
*JUN:	Will you have any exams this year? •_•
*COR:	Got loads! •_•
        I've got about twelve. •_•
*JUN:	For what? •_•
*COR:	Everything. •_•
        I've got  I've got one in March  for definite. •_•
*ALB:	What exams? •_•
*COR:	Yeah. •_•
        I don't know. •_•
        I think I've got one in April. •_•
*ALB:	You don't pay for them though do you? •_•
*COR:	I hope not. •_•
*ALB:	 ((laugh)) 
*JUN:	Ah! •_•
*ALB:	I hope not and all ! •_•
*COR:	I have one in April  two in May •_•
*ALB:	And what are they all on like? •_•
*COR:	three in June  or two in June  and then when we go back we've got  about three in September •_•
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*COR:	and we'll have some more at Christmas. •_•
*ALB:	They're not mock exams are they? •_•
*COR:	No. •_•
        Proper exams. •_•
        I've got my Red Cross in stage one, my R S A  part one and two, stage two. •_•
        I've got shorthand Pitman  not Pitman, R S A, shorthand Teeline  shorthand Teeline again at end of one, end of year. •_•
        And I've got another one in  word processing, hopefully. •_•
        I've got my audio. •_•
        My audio transcription  medical  and I've got my Teeline medical. •_•
*JUN:	Oh! •_•
*ALB:	Mhm. •_•
*COR:	And then after that I've got er that thing in for my  exams. •_•
        My proper  diploma exams. •_•
        None of them, there's only two of them that are to do with my diploma. •_•
        All the rest are at   fortunately. •_•
*JUN:	How long will you finish this? •_•
        Middle of next year or end of next year? •_•
*COR:	It'll be July when we take the exams. •_•
        That's when the course will actually finish. •_•
*ALB:	What, this July? •_•
*JUN:	No! •_•
*COR:	No. •_•
        That's right. •_•
        But I don't know how long it is before I get my results back. •_•
        But  you can get a post  as a medical secretary in a hospital or a G P without  having your full diploma. •_•
        If yous let it, cos  to get the full diploma you've got to get your two skills which is medical  audio, and medical shorthand, you've got to have them two skills  to get the diploma. •_•
        And you've also got four papers  ethics and  etiquette  you got an English one, a medical aspects one, and a clerical skills one. •_•
        Not a clerical skills one, but, office procedures. •_•
        And you've got to pass all them, plus your two skills  to get the diploma. •_•
        But you can resit any what you fail the following year. •_•
        Mm. •_•
*ALB:	Mm! •_•
*COR:	Teresa says, the only one what presents any difficulty is usually the medical aspects one. •_•
*ALB:	Well why should that present anything different? •_•
*COR:	Because it covers such a wide area. •_•
        It says the English paper you only need, you only need seventy five percent  for your  erm  it's seventy five percent pass rate. •_•
        You've got to get above seventy five to pass. •_•
        Yeah, it's  •_•
*ALB:	That's quite high that, you know, seventy five percent! •_•
*COR:	Well it's got to be ain't it? •_•
        The office procedures, she said, is simple anyway, and yet, ethics and etiquette is a, she said, and your teacher works you that hard and it just drills in anyway! •_•
*ALB:	No, but, seventy five percent is a high pass rate. •_•
*JUN:	Well I don't know  who she is that sends letters out to your nana, but she's bloody useless! •_•
        She misses more words out than she gets in! •_•
        And she just writes over them in, in pen! •_•
*ALB:	 ((laugh)) 
*COR:	If it's her computer though, they might just  erm, thingy it and change it to suit them. •_•
*ALB:	Well it wouldn't be on  word processor. •_•
*COR:	You don't know. •_•
*ALB:	Cos it's,you're supposed to  that's what it's for so you can check all your spellings. •_•
*JUN:	A lot of them letters that come out are already done and you just delete •_•
*COR:	Gonna say that's  they're all on word processor that's what I'm saying. •_•
        Eh! •_•
        I got a pass, oh I got a distinction for, we did er  like mock exam for  word processing, I got a pass. •_•
*JUN:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALB:	Whatsername  •_•
*COR:	 (        ) 
*ALB:	her in, her  the launderette were asking me  er  she was, she were on about I, ain't you got a job yet? •_•
        I said, I think I'm too qualified to get a job! •_•
        She said she said, well aye, you might be. •_•
        She says, int your  daughter  er  a nice girl? •_•
        I said, well aye  sometimes! •_•
*COR:	? •_•
*ALB:	She's seen you in there. •_•
        She says what's what's she do? •_•
        I said, oh she's at college. •_•
        Oh! •_•
        Really? •_•
        I says, she says er  what she's studying? •_•
        I said, well she's er  she's going in for medical secretary. •_•
        She said, well where does she get her brains from? •_•
*COR:	 ((laugh)) 
*ALB:	I I said well who do you think? •_•
        I says, I'm over- qualified for work, I says, and it looks like she's gonna end up that way if you're not careful! •_•
        She says, oh! •_•
        So  she said, I think she's ever so pretty! •_•
        I says, aye. •_•
        Said, pity her manners don't er mannerisms don't match her   looks ! •_•
*COR:	Teresa's on about  erm  she were asking me if anybody'd be interested into going on to higher er education after this? •_•
        And I  •_•
*ALB:	 ((cough)) 
*COR:	college yet! •_•
*ALB:	Yeah, but you get, you don't get no grant for that. •_•
*COR:	What college? •_•
        . But if it's only a part-time so you can actually work part-time that's the difference. •_•
*ALB:	Yeah. •_•
*COR:	Fantastic salary if you get qualified! •_•
*ALB:	It's alright if you can get day release from your  •_•
*JUN:	 ((cough)) 
*ALB:	work  to do it. •_•
        That's what you want to be after, day release. •_•

*ALB:	You do. •_•
*COR:	I mean, doing shorthand for four hours a day, it's  too much! •_•
        It's far too much! •_•
*JUN:	Well, just think, when you're working full-time you'd be working nine till five. •_•
*COR:	I know, but it's different when you're concentrating  •_•
*JUN:	Mind you  •_•
*COR:	on studying and when you're concentrating on working. •_•
