@Comment:	conversation #41 (Tape 018909)
*ANN:	I think we need to a empty the ashtray darling.
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Or do we get a new car?
*STU:	I think so   (.) I said   (.) said to the bloke before  (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah let's have it.
*STU:	 [shouting]  (        )  [] !
*ANN:	 ((sneeze)) Bless me.
*STU:	Oh!
*ANN:	 (        ) got a cold, you better go home.
*STU:	On traffic lights?
*ANN:	Yeah definitely    (        )  (.) poorly   (.) mother's sick for a fortnight.
*STU:	Well off we go, back to work.
*ANN:	Won't use so much petrol from now on anyway, to get to work will we?
*STU:	Wouldn't be a lot of difference actually.
*ANN:	Oh won't it?
*STU:	No   (.) By time you   (.) I mean it's not that far   (.) but   (.) by the time you get there the car won't have a chance to warm up thoroughly.
*ANN:	Oh, use more petrol, I see.
*STU:	So you'd be on automatic choke for a bit of the way, most of the way anyway so   (.)  (        ) 
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	a little bit, but not a great deal those gears most of the time as well the ones that we   (.) cruise in   (.) top gear   (.) I don't think that's really for me   (.)  (        ) 
*ANN:	Oh.
*STU:	Not appreciably amateur.
*ANN:	Ah   (.) sorry   (.) won't do it   (.) perhaps   (.) you turn li  (.) little bit there.
*STU:	A little bit perhaps     (.)  (        )  (.) I wouldn't of said it would have been   (.)  (        ) 
*ANN:	No cos they'll still be popping out to the  an  (.) will we not?
*STU:	I hope so.
*ANN:	Yeah so do I   (.) don't wanna lose touch with them now.
*STU:	That would be   (.) stroll up to the Royal Standard.
*ANN:	Yes, that's it   (.) some odd nights we was on our way home from work, it's   (        ) going up to the    (.) even when we're on earlies and   (.) and weekends we can   (.) go there can't we? (.) It's not that far   (.) there along the bypass there, it's not that far away is it?
*STU:	About that again, it's a similar distance I would say.
*ANN:	That's what I mean, it's not
*STU:	It's as near to the    (.) as it would have been from there    (        )  (.)  (        ) 
*ANN:	So it's not a lot of   (.) lot of bother   (.) the only thing is that i  (.) you gotta drive   (.) in town rather than drive   (.) on country lanes   (.) to get to the main roads     (.)  (        )  (.) little bit more   (.) dangerous   (.) as far as getting caught is concerned   (.) ha!
*STU:	It's    (        )  (.) we can always walk up the  (        ) .
*ANN:	Yep   (.) walk in the town if you're going
*STU:	Walk in the town.
*ANN:	if you want a good drink, doesn't matter does it? (.) Can you get through to town    (.)  (        ) there's no through road that way, other end, but couldn't is there any short cuts you get into town that way? (.) No?
*STU:	No, it's a longer way.
*ANN:	Is it?
*STU:	Yeah.
*ANN:	Ah I just wondered, I mean I don't know out that way.
*STU:	No   (.) erm   (.) might as well continue now   (.) half way round   (.) do a u-turn.
*ANN:	That's going the wrong way dear.
*STU:	Yeah looks like it dunnit?
*ANN:	Not sure of where he is   (.) mm mm.
*STU:	No the only w 
*ANN:	He's forgotten something.
*STU:	The only way to town is   (.) come up to way 
*ANN:	And come back again.
*STU:	towards   (        ) Boy's School   (.) then Corporation Road and then in town.
*ANN:	No I didn't know if you could walk   (.) if there's any   (.) short cuts if you wanted to walk into town.
*STU:	No   (.) no there's not.
*ANN:	I jus  (.) just wondered, not knowing the area as well as you do   (.) wondered if there was a little 
*STU:	You go down to the bottom of these roads there and   (.)  (        ) .
*ANN:	Do you end up sort of metal box end?
*STU:	No, there's metal boxes   (.) at each 
*ANN:	Well 
*STU:	end.
*ANN:	Yeah I know that's what I mean, if you get walking down there you'd come to all the factories I presume.
*STU:	If you come up   (.) er when you're at the Weasel Lane
*ANN:	Mm   (.) mhm.
*STU:	instead of turning up towards the Royal Standard you turn the other way, that comes down past  (        ) .
*ANN:	Mm.
*STU:	Then you go right down to the bottom of   (        ) Road you   (.) cos that's a dead end anyway, (        ) .
*ANN:	I didn't know if there was lanes going off into town,whe or oh I don't know.
*STU:	Mhm.
*ANN:	 (        )  (.) I shall have to be looking out for a second hand bike-y   (.) just for the occasional trip into town   (.) without getting Stuey out of bed   (.) so I be a bit more independent than just   (.) bothering you all time, if I just wanna pop anywhere.
*STU:	It isn't a great problem   (.) not really.
*ANN:	No I know my but it   (.) it'll give me a little independence as well will it not?
*STU:	You got a shop at the top of the road ain't you?
*ANN:	Yeah it's not far is it?
*STU:	Shops at the   (.) top there.
*ANN:	It's not far from Rainbow really, to do you main shopping if you   (.) in a hurry, is it?
*STU:	No   (.) that's up   (.) that's just up the   (.)  (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah   (.) not far.
*STU:	The new Tescos   (        ) won't be the other way will it?
*ANN:	The other way, no.
*STU:	 (        ) 
*ANN:	Yeah   (.) yeah that's what I mean it   (.) we're nearer to the both of them really.
