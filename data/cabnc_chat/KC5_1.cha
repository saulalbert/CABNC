*ALI:	Put her foot on it when she comes in  (  ) , that's her school bus, bus thirteen, do they fit her? Do they fit her?
*GAI:	Yeah   (.) only just, that's  (  ) .
*ALI:	When she comes in keep this out right?
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	And when she comes in, what's that one, put her left foot on it, right?
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	And if, if her foot overlaps it all, take them back, cos you might be better off just getting two anyway
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	cos Scott's, Scott's in a two football boot, there   (  ) sort of thing innit?
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	She's gonna wear her thick socks with them, (  ) dangling   (  ) aren't they?
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	That's what I'd be inclined to do    (.)  (  ) so
*GAI:	 (  )
*ALI:	 (  ) on top of the telly, and say just put your foot on here a minute, now, they look quite thin now, but, that's what I was looking at, yeah, cos her feet are fat, yeah, but they, that do like  that don't they?
*GAI:	 Yeah, that, yeah  , (  ) spreads out to the side anyway, don't it?
*ALI:	Yeah, put these  (  ) . Try her foot on it and if it don't, if her foot overlaps
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	then take them back up and get a two. Cos the thing is as well, I might be inclined to get a two anyway, because she wants it to last a little while don't she?
*GAI:	 Anyway  , yeah.
*ALI:	They're not gonna last very long not a   (  ) like that is it?  (.) Is that how it was?
*GAI:	Yeah. (  )  (.)
*GAI:	That was quick  (  ) .
*ALI:	Yeah  (  ) .
*GAI:	Yeah. I'm not going to do no housework today.
*ALI:	 (  ) , see mum and dad on Saturday at  (  ) .
*GAI:	Yeah. (  )  (.)  (  ) .
*ALI:	If erm
*GAI:	Go on.
*ALI:	if her foot's wide, wider than that would it matter?
*GAI:	Well yeah, cos it ought to be tight on her, across.
*ALI:	But if her foot's wider, you'll get the bigger size it'll take it up on the length bit.
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	So I'd be more inclined, let me have a look at her when she comes in, send her up.
*GAI:	Yeah  (.)
*ALI:	 (  ) see, is it, I mean sometimes Scott's foot too wide for a   (  ) both sides.
*GAI:	Mm.
*ALI:	Yeah    (.)  (  ) their trainers upstairs   (  ) they still, they fit alright.
*GAI:	Yeah.
*ALI:	They're not tight, that's why I went for a one cos I thought it's like a trainer innit?
*GAI:	Yeah   (.) yeah  (.)
*ALI:	You look quite a way  (  ) . (  )
