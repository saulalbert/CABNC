*CHR:	No because you forget it  in the end   
*DOR:	  ((laughing)) Oh yeah   
*CHR:	 lots of dreams like that. 
*DOR:	 that's right .

*DOR:	Mm mm. 
*TIM:	  ((singing))  (  )

*CHR:	 Mm. 
*TIM:	  ((singing))  (  )  
*DOR:	Sometimes you can wake up and you think, ooh that was very real and then when you think about it

*DOR:	you think, ooh that  was most   
*TIM:	  ((singing))  (  )  
*DOR:	odd!  (.) Couldn't possibly  of been real! 
*TIM:	  (  )   (.)  ((singing))  (  ) 
*DOR:	I think the night was full of dreams for all sorts of people   (  ) . 
*CHR:	 But mummy      (.)  (  )  (.) that   (.) I sort of thought Adele would act   (.)  (  ) . 
*DOR:	 ((laugh))  (.) But really you were in bed. 
*CHR:	Yeah. 
*DOR:	Mm mm.  (6.0) But sometimes when you're not very well and you get very very hot you get funny dreams, I think you had a very funny dream in the middle of last night didn't you?  (.) Do you remember? You were very frightened, we had to get you up   (.) read you a story   (.) have a cuddle   (.) put the light on. 
*CHR:	I couldn't remember when, I don't think. 
*DOR:	It was something like half past two in the morning!  (10.0) Anyway it didn't matter cos you were very good, and you went back to sleep again in the end   (.) then you didn't wake up till after daddy had gone to work this morning! ((road works in background)) 
*CHR:	No   (.) because then, I just looked   (.) over all those things that   (.) I went   (.) and   (.)  (  ) . 
*DOR:	Oh right. 
*CHR:	And then, I knocked at the   (  ) very   (.) weak   (.) leg. 
*DOR:	Aha. 
*CHR:	And when I looked at the clock, I was on time   (.) and  (  ) .

*DOR:	Now, do you think we can make it to the post box   (.) let's go and have a try shall we? 
*CHR:	Mhm.

*UNK:	What is that? 
*DOR:	Oh yes, attached to it, and you've just had yourself taped by the way. 
*UNK:	  ((laughing)) Have we?  (.) What for ?

*UNK:	  ((laugh))  
*DOR:	 for a week  .  (.) Which is all very entertaining! 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*DOR:	And sometimes I, sort of  
*UNK:	 ((laughing))  (  ) ! 
*DOR:	things like that, but I'm sure they'll sort it out. 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	I presume that's why it's for a week, you know? 
*UNK:	Yeah. 
*DOR:	Out of twenty tapes surely they'll be one that 
*UNK:	 ((laugh)) 
*DOR:	wouldn't    (.)  ((laughing)) will   (  ) !  (.) Oh dear! We'll make our way down to the post box first, and then we'll come back and   (.) get bits and pieces on the way Christopher.  (.) Goes through phases of being quite   (.) quite boisterous 
*UNK:	Yes. 
*DOR:	and then other times of being 
*UNK:	Mm. 
*DOR:	pathetic!  (.) But that's probably due to  
*UNK:	  (  )  
*DOR:	yesterday. 
*UNK:	he's still   (.) hot
