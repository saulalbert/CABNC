*BRE:	Erm, for the suit for Len.
*JEA:	Oh yes of course.
*BRE:	He hates shopping on a Saturday.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	But I should think knowing he'll know what's it like, he normally parks down by the old A A
*JEA:	Oh yes.
*BRE:	and walks in.
*JEA:	Mm, mm  (.) 
*BRE:	Do you ever cook, this coronation chicken at home?
*JEA:	Yes I have made it, mm, its easy.

*BRE:	That's what I was   (        ) said, have you got your, that's Debenhams receipt there?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	I'd like to see what the   (        ) got off.
*JEA:	Mm  (.)

*JEA:	Yes I
*BRE:	Put it 
*JEA:	Yes 
*BRE:	in with the   (        ) card?
*JEA:	I did, yes.
*BRE:	As long as you've picked your Debs card up.
*JEA:	Its a question of finding   (        ) card  (.) 
*BRE:	What's that? (.) oh no, no till receipt.
*JEA:	This is the bill isn't it? can I have the card ha, ha, ha, ha, (        ) , my ability to leave, loose these things is, is wonderful, (        )  (.) 
*BRE:	So   (.) that black top that sweatshirt top that I'd got for Lee, it was seventeen ninety nine, you got that for thirteen pounds, forty five   (.) erm   (.) thirty two pound off.
*JEA:	Mm, that's marvellous, so it should of been a hundred and forty five  (        ) .
*BRE:	Yeah, there's a hell of a difference ain't there?
*JEA:	Yes, it is.
*BRE:	But the only thing awkward I suppose about that is the fact you've got to erm, carry it around.
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	Why, I mean alright should you so that one of the   (        ) would, is that, carry it around for you.
*JEA:	You don't like to ask do you?
*BRE:	But you don't like to because of that   (.) you know, you'll be erm, sort of lugging it around and
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	and you'd feel you'd actually have to sort of hurry him up wouldn't you, you know hurry up because 
*JEA:	Yes, yes   (.) When I have, have been entertaining Shirley and Terry , doing an evening meal on a Saturday or a Sunday, sometimes both to help Shirley when she's getting into the run of going back to work   (.) I found that one of the cheapest of dinner party deserts is lemon meringue pie
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	everybody likes it.
*BRE:	It always goes down well, don't they 
*JEA:	Mm .
*BRE:	Christmas time, whatever.
*JEA:	Mm   (.) and to take the    (        )  (.) I   (.) grate the lemon the day before and wrapped the grated rind in cling film.
*BRE:	Yeah you do that didn't you?
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	I know that one you made last time you were down was a
*JEA:	That's right darling .
*BRE:	no waste in our house.
*JEA:	No, hope not   ((laugh))  (.) 
*BRE:	What's Ken and Marg having turkey at Christmas or
*JEA:	Mm?
*BRE:	are they having turkey at Christmas or don't they, don't you know?
*JEA:	I don't know what there'll have, you see Naomi and Mitch are vegetarian  (.) 
*BRE:	Are they going for dinner as well at   (.) Simon's?
*JEA:	Oh I think so, yes, I think it's going to be a proper family Christmas  (.) 
*BRE:	Probably like you say, if you turn it down
*JEA:	Oh that would be awful.
*BRE:	Before 
*UNK:	Number eleven .
*BRE:	even this, it's probably this one year you could probably eat a   (        ) 
*JEA:	I could of done the same at home, I would of liked to have looked after Neil   (.) and kept my own electric   (        ) 
*BRE:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	Yes, everybody, yes.It's fairly typical though isn't it one year you 
*BRE:	Mm, mm .
*JEA:	could do with
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	staying around   (.) you mean  (        ) .I think that Neil is a bit of a sensitive area.
*BRE:	Mm.
*JEA:	You know, cos I'm, I'm spending money and time on him that really has those in theory I would be spending on my own grand children, however, I take the attitude that in modern times, people don't, people are not obliged
*BRE:	The thing is today our 
*JEA:	To feel , by duty as it were, that they ought to take notice of their immediate family, John and Maryann are capable of financially supporting themselves, so I don't worry about the money aspect and in every other way physiologically, emotionally, immorally they, they are able to look after themselves Neil isn't .
*BRE:	But I think, yeah, and I think that, that, saying   (.) you can't pick your families, you can pick your friends.
*JEA:	Mm, this is true.
*BRE:	So true
*JEA:	Mm.
*BRE:	because nine times out of ten
*JEA:	You found it so?
*BRE:	 ((eating))well you can do without without that hassle, I mean, with   (        ) a relationship you've got a good  (        ) 
*JEA:	Mm, mm.
*BRE:	at least, there's not a lot of types that have hassle's.
*JEA:	No, no.
*BRE:	But that's how relationships should be.
*JEA:	Mm, mm   (.) its one of the great arguments from the old fashioned sort of religion, that you could turn, you could definitely turn to people and say   (.) why are you leaning on me so hard, for all this to fought, you ought to be reading your bible, saying your prayers, going to church and getting in touch with the boss   (.) why I laughed when they were saying that Terry Waite would need counselling, I bet that Terry Waite was praying his head off and he'd memorised masses of the bible which he would be reciting to himself probably set himself two o'clock every afternoon, I remember what I can, book of   (        ) you know   (.) I don't suppose he'd needed any counselling, he'd probably do better counselling other people.
*BRE:	That's right, yeah, cos I mean he's, he's certainly sort of, even though he's been sort of prisoner, I mean, he's seen what's going on and, and he's had what five years of it?
*JEA:	Yes, yeah.
*BRE:	and he's sort of life sort of gone.
*UNK:	 (        ) .
*BRE:	Oh thank you   (.) This is delicious.
*JEA:	Beautiful stuff isn't it?Mm .
*BRE:	Really have some more  (.) 
*JEA:	In East Anglia, people either in, eh, on their pub lunches there, how they throw themselves onto that, all on too treacle pudding.
*BRE:	Yeah, but, oh, eh, it a bit heavy though in it?, sometimes it
*JEA:	Or home made 
*BRE:	It's nice .
*JEA:	bread and butter pudding with custard or death by chocolate  ((laugh)) .
*BRE:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	We really eat in East Anglia   ((laugh))  (.) 
*BRE:	Obviously   (        ) in white jumpers.
*JEA:	No, she looks nice.
*BRE:	Mm, yes   (.) where do you think they look, they have got some nice mens    (        )  (        ) .
*JEA:	Yes .
*BRE:	I mean 
*JEA:	Mm 
*BRE:	half the women I think buy men clothes
*JEA:	Mm, mm   (.) do you buy Dave's clothes for him?
*BRE:	No, I meant women buy them to wear.
*JEA:	Oh yes, they 
*BRE:	Women  (        ) , erm from men's departments, cos they just, like she said they, I don't know why, but they just seemed to sort of 
*JEA:	Well, men, the fabrics of men's   (        ) usually better, stronger
*BRE:	mm.
*JEA:	because men feel cold more, I mean they can wear, if you think about it they were suits in the middle of summer where were into sleeveless   (        ) 
*BRE:	Yeah .
*JEA:	Erm, and, er, the colours for men by tradition are much, I think are much subtler   (.) mm  (.) .Well I hope they re-open the Bernie, this isn't too bad actually, but, I like, you know 
*BRE:	This is quite nice .
*JEA:	it's done, done us well enough, but I do prefer a Bernie.
*BRE:	Mm   ((eating))that was   (        ) do you remember that girl she was always
*JEA:	Oh yeah
*BRE:	Sweet wasn't she 
*JEA:	Lovely, girl 
*BRE:	very cheerful
*JEA:	yes.
*BRE:	very, very nice.
*JEA:	I wonder if they have, come up against the rapacity of the, of the rates.
*BRE:	Don't you remember they kept saying, they kept saying there gonna shut it down, shut it down, and then six months later we went round there, oh no there no shut 
*JEA:	No, yes , yeah   (.) yes  (.) 
*BRE:	God its a great, a great sort of burden off isn't it all this sort of shopping erm, just got to go in Smiths and, we, I 
*JEA:	Paynes 
*BRE:	goodness knows the  (        ) .
*JEA:	What have we got to do next?
*BRE:	Smiths, we'll go in there next.
*JEA:	And I must make a real effort to find one of these machines that's working.
*BRE:	Try the Post Office.

*UNK:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	And that, thank you.
*BRE:	And that one, look, you can have them all.
*JEA:	A heavy cold will stop me doing them justice  (.) 
*BRE:	It is really busy though    (        )  (.) So is Jackie spending Christmas on her own or   (.) you don't know?
*JEA:	No, I think that there'll probably go down to the mum and slept there   (        ) 
*BRE:	I was gonna say that , was they made, have they made friends where they are?
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	No.
*JEA:	There aren't any people where they are.
*BRE:	Aren't there?
*JEA:	Well, there are next door neighbours, who I think are very nice, but I don't think that Jackie and Ned got a lot in common with them   (.) that's,tha that's one house that adjoins them and then a little further on, its a lane, its about as wide as this Brenda.
*BRE:	Oh, well why'd they moved?What, what area is it?
*JEA:	Its called Fen, Fen Lane
*BRE:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	and its in between Creeping St. Mary and  (        ) .

*JEA:	About erm, between ten and fifteen minutes drive I suppose, ten minutes perhaps.
*BRE:	Oh it's not far
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	does she still do her kitchen job?
*JEA:	Yes, and she phoned me and she said I feel as though I dropped out of the bottom of the world she said, you know, I just don't see anybody, I said well of course you were working on Mondays, you see she used to have Mondays to herself and I would often go round on a Monday afternoon and, we, we could talk, but that's gone and I said I can't run in at half past five when you get home from school and chat to you because Ned will be coming home at six and I don't want to be there all that often when he's there   (.) erm   (.) its   (.) you know, its just happened and I also thought to myself and I'm probably going to move a lot further away then Fen Lane.
*BRE:	But she doesn't, I mean she doesn't bother that much now does she?
*JEA:	No.
*BRE:	I mean I think it counts that she's not 
*JEA:	To tell you the truth Brenda, I'm very sorry for her because I think that she and Ned have made a   (.) really a quite ferocious mess of their life, they've never intended to be slaving away to be doing kitchen fitting, he wanted to do wood sculpture that was he's idea in
*BRE:	And slow down a bit you   (        ) was 
*JEA:	yes, yes , he's on the gallop and looks very old and worn
*BRE:	Does he?
*JEA:	Mm   (.) and she never wanted to return to full time teaching, its, its   (        ) for her that she's got a job that she's very good at and she enjoy, in an extremely nice school.
*BRE:	 (        ) .
*JEA:	 (        ) such as it is   (        ) if she is  (        ) , no, I have to go to the   (.) a loo or something get some paper, I shan't worry about them, such a  (        ) .
